REM  build_wpnfix.bat  -  rebuilds zone_source\wpnfix_donor\mod.ff
REM
REM  WHY THIS EXISTS
REM    zone_source\base\mod.ff (the donor) carries m1911_zm, m1911_upgraded_zm,
REM    m1911lh_upgraded_zm and c96_zm whose fire aliases are wpn_m1911_* and
REM    wpn_mc96_* - names that exist in NO Black Ops II sound bank, ZM or MP.
REM    The guns were therefore silent. Retail's own copies name wpn_1911_*,
REM    which every map bank declares and which the user's sound pack replaces.
REM
REM    The Linker is FIRST-LOAD-WINS and has no override flag, so a raw source
REM    file cannot beat the donor. Plutonium's runtime raw-weapon loader cannot
REM    either - it refuses a name mod.ff already owns ("Failed to load weapon").
REM    The only route is to supply the name from a zone loaded AHEAD of the
REM    donor, which is what this tiny fastfile does.
REM
REM    Measured safe: 326 assets, ZERO overlap with anything zm_qol's own zones
REM    declare and ZERO overlap with its raw sources in zone_assets\.
