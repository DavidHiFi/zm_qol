//  quality_of_life.gsc  -  merged root-level QoL/gameplay scripts
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Single-file merge of what used to be 17 separate loose root scripts
//  (BO2DD, bo4maxammo, bocw_round, buried_animated_camo + animated_camo,
//  counterszm, custom_summary, deathmachine_powerup, high_round_fix,
//  instant_pap, No_Fog, noperklimit, perkbonuspoints, secretsongsurvival,
//  zm_expanded, zm_hitmarkers, zm_wallbuy_fills_clip,
//  areanotifier) plus the perk pop-up HUD - originally from
//  custom_perkanimuncompiled, REPLACED 2026-07-30 by the "Vanguard Perk
//  Animation" HUD (techboy04gaming / NewMartinLag), which lives in its own
//  section below (search "Vanguard Perk Animation") and no longer hooks
//  give_perk() at all.
//
//  NOTE (2026-07-30): Disable_Fog_Transition was briefly merged into this
//  file, then moved back OUT to the TranZit-scoped script
//  scripts/zm/zm_transit/disable_fog_transition.gsc. Its reference to
//  maps\mp\zm_transit_fx::precache_createfx_fx is resolved by T6 at script
//  LOAD time (not at the replaceFunc call site), so a root script holding it
//  threw "Unresolved external: precache_createfx_fx" on every non-TranZit
//  map even behind an if(mapname == "zm_transit") guard.
//
//  Every function keeps its original body. Only names that collided across
//  files (init, main, onplayerconnect, onplayerspawned, and the two competing
//  get_pack_a_punch_weapon_options overrides) were renamed/merged - see the
//  per-module comments for the mapping back to the original file.

//  zmqol_enable_dog_rounds  -  HELLHOUNDS DROPPED FROM DINER AND NUKETOWN
//                                                    (v2.3.4, fixed for real v2.3.8)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User, 2026-08-25: *"because of how much of a hassle it's been to get
//  hellhounds working on Diner survival, and Nuketown survival, just drop it
//  at this point ... leave the regular vanilla stock game hellhound supported
//  maps eg. bus depot, farm, town ... exactly as they are."*
//
//  🛑 v2.3.4 GOT NUKETOWN WRONG: it hid the lobby row and assumed that was
//  enough, leaving this function's stock body running unchanged for Nuketown.
//  It was never verified against the tweakable's own default. It is not
//  enabled=0: `_tweakables.gsc:342`, `registertweakable( "killstreak",
//  "allowdogs", "scr_hardpoint_allowdogs", 1 )` - the trailing 1 IS the
//  default. With the lobby row gone, nothing ever writes this setting, so
//  `getgametypesetting( "allowdogs" )` in zstandard.gsc resolves to that
//  default of 1 (ON) - hiding the toggle made hellhounds unconditionally ON,
//  the opposite of "drop it". User confirmed 2026-08-26 they still see them.
//  Fixed by folding Nuketown into this same no-op, keyed on `mapname` (its
//  own map file, unlike Diner which is a location inside zm_transit).
//
//  🛑 THE LOBBY ROW COULD NOT BE REMOVED FOR DINER ALONE, AND THIS IS WHY.
//  Nuketown's row WAS its own mod-only addition and its removal
//  (privategamelobby_project.lua) is correct to keep - it just was not
//  sufficient by itself, per above. Diner's row is NOT its own - there is no
//  Diner-specific entry in GameTypeSettings[5].maps anywhere in that file.
//  Every TranZit survival location (Diner, Farm, Town, Bus Depot) shares the
//  SAME stock row, `maps[1] = "zm_transit"`, because the lobby's map
//  whitelist works by MAP FILE, not by location - Diner has no map file of
//  its own, it is a location inside zm_transit's. Removing that row to hide
//  it from Diner would ALSO hide it from Bus Depot / Farm / Town, which the
//  user explicitly wants kept exactly as they are. So the lobby option stays
//  VISIBLE on Diner - this is a real, reported limitation, not silently
//  dropped - and this hook is what makes it functionally inert there instead.
//
//  🌟 THE HOOK POINT, AND WHY zstandard_main() ITSELF CANNOT BE ONE. Every
//  TranZit survival location runs the same shared
//  maps\mp\gametypes_zm\zstandard.gsc::zstandard_main():
//        level.dog_rounds_allowed = getgametypesetting( "allowdogs" );
//        if ( level.dog_rounds_allowed )
//            maps\mp\zombies\_zm_ai_dogs::enable_dog_rounds();
//  zstandard_main itself is called through an UNQUALIFIED same-file pointer
//  (`rungametypemain( "zstandard", ::zstandard_main )`), which AI_CONTEXT's
//  replaceFunc rule 1 rules out - replaceFunc cannot see a caller that never
//  goes through the qualified name. enable_dog_rounds() one line down IS
//  called fully qualified, so it is the earliest hookable point in the chain.
//  Nuketown's own zstandard.gsc runs the identical three lines (verified,
//  `Nuketown\maps\mp\gametypes_zm\zstandard.gsc:39`), so the same hook point
//  covers it with no separate registration needed.
//
//  🌟 THIS REPRODUCES STOCK'S ENTIRE FUNCTION BODY FOR EVERY MAP EXCEPT
//  DINER AND NUKETOWN - read from _zm_ai_dogs.gsc:49-57, copied verbatim
//  below the checks, not reinvented. Bus Depot, Farm, Town, and every other
//  hellhound map (Die Rise, Mob, Buried, Origins) call this exact same
//  function and get the exact same behaviour they always have; only the
//  Diner and Nuketown branches differ.

//  POWER-UP TIMERS  -  seconds remaining under each power-up icon   (v1.99.0)
//
//  User, 2026-08-16, supplying a mod from the Plutonium forums
//  (H:\Claude\POWER UP TIMERS): *"make this an option toggable in the HUD
//  options ... it just shows the seconds remaining for all power ups, make it
//  aware of added/modded in power ups like the death machine as well."*
//
//  The server half of that mod appends the live timers to a client dvar so the
//  LUI can read them; the LUI half draws them under each icon. The idea is
//  sound and the LUI half is used close to verbatim.
//
//  🛑 THE FORUM MOD AS SHIPPED WOULD KILL EVERY MAP WITHIN A SECOND, AND IT IS
//  NOT SUBTLE. Its version of this function ends with an UNCONDITIONAL
//      self setclientdvar( "powerup_times", str );
//  and stock calls this function from a loop that is `wait 0.05` -
//  _zm_powerups.gsc:208-263 - once per PLAYER per POWER-UP TYPE per tick. With
//  the six client fields this mod registers that is **120 setclientdvar calls
//  per second per player**.
//
//  setclientdvar is a RELIABLE SERVER COMMAND and the reliable ring holds 128
//  entries (ERROR_CATALOGUE §7b). That is a guaranteed
//  EXE_ERR_RELIABLE_CYCLED_OUT in about one second - and it is the SAME crash
//  class this project already has open and unexplained on Origins and Mob, so
//  shipping it would also have poisoned that investigation.
//
//  🌟 THE FIX IS FREE, BECAUSE THE CLIENT ONLY EVER DRAWS WHOLE SECONDS.
//  hudpowerupszombie.lua renders math.ceil(t). So the string is built from
//  int( ceil ) values and sent ONLY when it actually differs from the last one
//  sent to that player. While a power-up runs that is at most one command per
//  second; with none running it is zero. The cache lives on the PLAYER, so it
//  cannot leak between players or survive a reconnect.
//
//  📝 IT IS AUTOMATICALLY AWARE OF ADDED POWER-UPS **that register a
//  client_field_name**. The list is not hardcoded - it is whatever stock's own
//  loop iterates, which is every entry in level.zombie_powerups that has one.
//
//  🛑 v1.99.2 - THIS COMMENT USED TO CLAIM THE DEATH MACHINE WAS COVERED "WITH
//  NO EXTRA WORK". IT WAS NOT, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY ITS TIMER NEVER DREW.
//  The user reported it missing on 2026-08-16. The mod registers the power-up
//  with SEVEN arguments:
//
//      add_zombie_powerup( "deathmachine", "zombie_pickup_minigun",
//                          &"ZOMBIE_POWERUP_MINIGUN", ::drop_deathmachine, 0, 0, 0 );
//
//  and client_field_name / time_name / on_name are arguments NINE, TEN and
//  ELEVEN (_zm_powerups.gsc:414). So .client_field_name is undefined, the loop
//  below hits its `continue` on the very first check, and the Death Machine was
//  never in the string at all. The claim was written from what the code ought to
//  have done rather than from the call - the exact failure CLAUDE.md forbids.
//
//  🌟 THE FIX IS NOT TO REGISTER A CLIENTFIELD FOR IT. The Death Machine's icon
//  is driven by the `deathmachine_powerup_state` DVAR, not a clientfield -
//  hudpowerupszombie.lua:622 DeathMachineDvarUpdate reads that dvar and
//  dispatches the "deathmachine_powerup" event itself. Adding a real clientfield
//  would cost bits on every map and risk EXE_CLIENT_FIELD_MISMATCH for a display
//  path that already works. So its remaining time is appended explicitly, from
//  the end time stamped at pickup - see the block after the loop.
//
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  🛑 v1.99.1 - WHY THE v1.99.0 VERSION OF THIS COULD NEVER HAVE WORKED.
//
//  v1.99.0 did this by replaceFunc'ing _zm_powerups::set_clientfield_powerups.
//  The user booted it and reported no timers at all. The reason is CLAUDE.md §4
//  failure mode #1, and it is visible in the stock source:
//
//      _zm_powerups.gsc:257   player set_clientfield_powerups( ... );
//
//  That call is UNQUALIFIED, SAME-FILE and SYNCHRONOUS. The one verified
//  exception to that failure mode in this project (_zm::onallplayersready) was
//  `level thread`-ed, and the working theory for why it hooks is precisely that
//  threaded calls resolve through the redirectable pointer table while a plain
//  synchronous local call is compiled to a direct jump. This call site is not
//  threaded, so the hook was dead on arrival.
//
//  🌟 SO THE HOOK IS GONE. We now read the SAME source data stock's own loop
//  reads (level/player .zombie_vars, keyed off level.zombie_powerups) from our
//  OWN thread. That cannot silently fail to run, and - a real bonus - it no
//  longer replaces a core function, so stock's icon/flashing behaviour is
//  untouched and there is nothing to regress.
//
//  Rate: this loop is 2 Hz and still only writes the dvar when the whole string
//  CHANGES, so it stays at =<1 reliable command per second per player while a
//  power-up runs and 0 otherwise. The ring is 128 entries (ERROR_CATALOGUE §7b).
//
//  📝 STILL NOT HARDCODED TO A POWER-UP LIST - it walks level.zombie_powerups
//  exactly as stock does, so the Death Machine and anything added later are
//  covered for free.

//  zmqol_restore_perk_bottles_on_survival
//
//  🛑 Fixes: drinking a perk from the Wunderfizz on any custom survival location
//     plays no animation and leaves the player permanently unable to sprint,
//     shoot or melee. Reported on Origins/Trenches 2026-08-02.
//
//  THE CHAIN, traced end to end:
//
//  1. maps\mp\zombies\_zm_perks::perk_machine_spawn_init() only spawns a perk
//     machine when a "zm_perk_machine" struct's script_string contains
//     "<ui_gametype>_perks_<start location>". Dumping every shipped mapents with
//     OAT's Unlinker shows NO struct is tagged for any location this mod adds:
//         zm_tomb  - 6 structs, 5 tagged "zclassic_perks_tomb", 1 untagged (the
//                    Pack-a-Punch). Nothing for trenches/excavation_site/church/
//                    crazy_place. (zm_qol ships no zm_tomb mapents at all.)
//         zm_highrise 8/8 tagged, zm_prison 11/11, zm_transit 43/43, zm_buried
//                    14/14 - none tagged for Diner, Tunnel, Power, Docks, or the
//                    three Die Rise locations.
//     So those locations spawn ZERO perk machines.
//
//  2. _zm_perks::init() then does (stock line ~52):
//         vending_triggers = getentarray( "zombie_vending", "targetname" );
//         ...move every "specialty_weapupgrade" trigger OUT of that array...
//         if ( vending_triggers.size < 1 )
//             return;                       <-- BAILS
//     Origins' one untagged machine IS the Pack-a-Punch, so it gets moved out and
//     the array is empty. init() returns early on every custom survival location.
//
//  3. Everything that builds the perk-bottle system lives AFTER that return:
//         level.machine_assets = [];
//         [[ level.custom_vending_precaching ]]();   <- precacheitem() of every
//                                                       "zombie_perk_bottle_*"
//                                                       and the machine_assets
//                                                       lookup table
//
//  4. The Wunderfizz still works and still hands out perks, because
//     _zm_perk_random is a separate system. On grab it calls
//     _zm_perks::perk_give_bottle_begin( perk ), which does:
//         self increment_is_drinking();
//         self disable_player_move_states( 1 );      <- sprint/fire/melee OFF
//         weapon = level.machine_assets["juggernog"].weapon;   <- undefined table
//         self giveweapon( weapon ); self switchtoweapon( weapon );
//     With no weapon to switch to, "weapon_change_complete" never fires, so
//     _zm_perk_random::grab_check() blocks forever on its waittill_any_return and
//     perk_give_bottle_end() - the ONLY caller of enable_player_move_states() -
//     never runs. That is the reported soft-lock exactly.
//
//  THE FIX
//
//  Do what the bail skipped: create level.machine_assets and run the map's own
//  vending precache. custom_vending_precaching touches no entities - it is purely
//  precacheitem/precachemodel/loadfx plus building machine_assets - so calling it
//  without any machines present is safe. Its first block also walks
//  level._custom_perks[*].precache_func, which is what precaches
//  "zombie_perk_bottle_cherry" for Electric Cherry (specialty_grenadepulldeath is
//  in Origins' Wunderfizz rotation but has no case in perk_give_bottle_begin's
//  switch - it resolves through level._custom_perks[perk].perk_bottle instead).
//
//  Root script on purpose: the same bail hits Origins x4, Die Rise x3, Docks,
//  Diner, Tunnel and Power. Nothing referenced here is map-specific -
//  level.custom_vending_precaching is a level var and _zm_perks is globally safe
//  per AI_CONTEXT rule 2 - so this is legal in quality_of_life.gsc.
//
//  Guards:
//    - is_classic() -> never touches a classic map, where init() does not bail.
//    - isdefined( level.machine_assets ) -> no-ops wherever _zm_perks::init()
//      completed normally, so any location that already worked is untouched. This
//      is also what makes it safe if perk machines are ever added to a loc script
//      or the mapents get patched: the fix simply stops applying.
//    - level.custom_vending_precaching is defaulted here because stock only
//      defaults it AFTER the bail; maps that do not set it themselves would
//      otherwise have it undefined. (Origins sets it in zm_tomb::main().)
//
//  Must run in init(): level.custom_vending_precaching and level._custom_perks are
//  populated by the map's main(), which runs after this mod's main(). init() is
//  still inside the precache window - the precacheitem() calls immediately below
//  in this same function have always worked.

//  zm_qol: DISCORD RICH PRESENCE - THE MOD'S NAME ON THE PLAYER'S PROFILE
//
//  User request, 2026-09-05: *"add custom discord rpc just like how the bo2
//  reimagined mod does, but for my Quality of life mod ... this way if someone
//  is using my mod people can see based off viewing their profile on discord."*
//
//  There is NO Discord API in GSC and none in LUI, and Plutonium's own rich
//  presence cannot be replaced by a mod. What it CAN be fed is the server name.
//  Measured 2026-09-05 out of plutonium-bootstrapper-win32.exe: the presence
//  code's string block is
//        cl_enableStreamerMode | mapname | g_gametype | sv_hostname |
//        sv_maxclients | cl_ingame | \^\d|\^:|\^; | %s on %s | loopback | Main menu
//  - five dvars, a colour-code stripper, and "<gametype> on <map>". The line
//  UNDER that one on a Discord profile is sv_hostname, so writing the mod's
//  name there is what puts "Quality Of Life" in front of anyone who looks.
//
//  🌟 THE WORKING PRECEDENT, and the mod the user pointed at:
//  BO2-Reimagined\scripts\zm\_zm_reimagined.gsc:855-856, set_dvars(), called
//  from that file's own init():
//        setDvar( "sv_hostname", "Reimagined" );
//        makedvarserverinfo( "sv_hostname" );
//  No Discord code anywhere in that repo - this dvar IS its "custom RPC".
//
//  Why the guard: three values mean "nobody chose this name", and only those are
//  replaced.
//        ""               nothing set yet
//        "CoDHost"        stock gametypes_zm\_serversettings.gsc:6-11, which
//                         writes it whenever sv_hostname is empty
//        "Private Match"  🌟 what PLUTONIUM itself puts there for a private
//                         match - measured 2026-09-05 in the user's own dvar
//                         dump (console_zm.log: sv_hostname "Private Match")
//  Anything else is a server owner's or a player's own name and is left alone,
//  which doubles as the opt-out. Stock's 5-second updateserversettings() loop
//  only READS sv_hostname (:64-68), so nothing fights this back.
//
//  🛑 v2.12.2 SHIPPED WITHOUT THE "Private Match" CASE AND DID NOTHING AT ALL.
//  The user's profile still read "Private Match" and the log said
//  `sv_hostname is already 'Private Match' - left alone`. That log line is also
//  the proof this route works: the third line of a Discord profile is
//  sv_hostname VERBATIM - "Private Match" was never a Discord label, it was the
//  dvar's value. Write the mod's name there and the mod's name is what shows.

//  zmqol_nuke_powerup  -  v1.99.48. INSTANT NUKE.
//
//  User request, 2026-08-18: "instead of the typical stock/vanilla effect of the
//  nuke where it sequentially kills the zombies one after another and takes a
//  little bit to finish and then give the points... it'll skip the sequence of
//  killing zombies, and just kill all the zombies at once that it normally
//  would, not any more or any less zombies though stock amount of zombies die to
//  the nuke it just is instant same with the points."
//
//  🌟 THIS IS STOCK'S OWN FUNCTION WITH ONE LINE GATED, AND NOTHING ELSE.
//  _zm_powerups::nuke_powerup() (:1445-1505) is straight-line code with no
//  branching to lose, so it can be reproduced exactly. The ONLY difference is
//  the first line of the kill loop:
//
//        wait( randomfloatrange( 0.1, 0.7 ) );      <- stock, per zombie
//
//  which is what staggers the deaths and is the whole of what the user is asking
//  to skip. Everything else is byte-for-byte stock's:
//    - the same `wait 0.5` before any killing, so the flash and its sound keep
//      their stock timing;
//    - the same four skip tests (ignore_nuke, marked_for_death,
//      nuke_damage_func, magic bullet shield), so **exactly the stock set of
//      zombies dies - no more, no fewer**, which the user asked for twice;
//    - the same `i < 5` cap on flame_death_fx, the same head gib, the same
//      "evt_nuked" per zombie, the same dodamage( health + 666, origin ) with no
//      attacker (which is why a nuke gives no hitmarkers, stock behaviour kept);
//    - the same 400 points to every player on the team, through stock's own
//      _zm_score::player_add_points.
//
//  🛑 THE DVAR IS READ ONCE, HERE, NOT PER ZOMBIE. Reading it inside the loop
//  would let a mid-nuke toggle strand half a wave, which is a state no stock
//  path can produce. One read at the top means a nuke behaves one way from start
//  to finish.
//
//  📝 DEFAULT ON. Same call as the power-up timers in v1.99.0: the user asked
//  for the feature, not merely for a switch. `instant_nuke 0` is exact vanilla -
//  the same function, taking the same wait stock takes.
//
//  📝 replaceFunc on a same-file unqualified call is safe HERE and it is not a
//  guess: _zm_powerups.gsc:1007 calls it as `level thread nuke_powerup(...)`,
//  and the threaded form is the case verified hookable in this project - the
//  mod's own new_full_ammo_powerup() below hooks :1014, the very next line of
//  the same switch, and has worked in game for many releases.

//  zmqol_wait_out_intro_cutscene  -  THE SOLO INTRO CUTSCENE GATE, server half
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User, 2026-08-30, on Origins solo: they skipped the intro part-way through
//  and *"when i spawned in the zombies were right near me already and had
//  already broke through the barrier"*.
//
//  🛑 ROUND DELAY OFF IS NOT THE CAUSE, and that is checked rather than
//  assumed. Both halves of that switch are guarded:
//      round_one_up()   `&& !level.first_round`   - round one always blocks for
//                       its full 6.25 + 2 seconds, threaded on no other round
//      zombie_between_round_time = 0   - read by round_over(), which round one
//                       never reaches until it is over
//  Neither can move a single frame of round one. The switch is innocent.
//
//  🌟 WHAT ACTUALLY OVERLAPS IS THIS MOD'S OWN CUTSCENE. ui_mp/t6/hud/loading.lua
//  plays video/<map>_load.webm only when party_maxplayers == 1, and stock never
//  reaches that on a Plutonium private match - zm_qol turns it on deliberately
//  by forcing the party size (privateonlinegamelobby.lua::zmQolForceSoloPartySize).
//  So there is no vanilla behaviour to restore here: the mod added a video and
//  never told the match to wait for it. Measured lengths, read out of each
//  file's Matroska Duration element x TimecodeScale:
//      zm_tomb_load     196.2s      zm_prison_load    170.6s
//      zm_buried_load   158.0s      zm_highrise_load   78.6s
//  Against that, round one's whole grace is 8.25 seconds.
//
//  🌟 THE SIGNAL IS EXACT, NOT A TIMER. loading.lua's own skip handler - the
//  only thing anywhere that calls Engine.Stop3DCinematic, and what both the
//  SKIP button and the mouse-click path run - now writes `zmqol_cutscene` 0,
//  and the movie branch writes 1. Solo is the only case that can reach that
//  branch, and solo on Plutonium is a listen server, so the LUI writing the
//  dvar and this function reading it are the same process. That channel is not
//  new or hopeful: zmQolForceSoloPartySize already hands `zmqol_loadmovie_probe`
//  to init() exactly this way and it arrives (see zmqol_loadmovie_probe()).
//
//  🛑 THREE THINGS STOP THIS EVER HANGING A MATCH, because a gate that sticks
//  would be far worse than the bug it fixes:
//    1. loading.lua clears the dvar to 0 at the TOP of every loading screen, so
//       a game quit mid-cutscene cannot leave it set for the next one.
//    2. the map test below - only the four maps that own a *_load.webm can gate
//       at all, so a stale 1 is inert on Diner, TranZit, Nuketown and Grief.
//    3. the deadline - 210s, comfortably past the longest video, after which it
//       gives up and plays on regardless.

    //       Stop3DCinematic handler (the SKIP button and the click path).
    //    2. the player looks around - while the video is up the client is in a
    //       menu and no view input reaches the server, so the first change in
    //       view angles is proof they are actually in the world. This is the
    //       one that covers a video ENDING BY ITSELF: nothing in loading.lua
    //       says the engine runs the skip handler in that case, so the dvar
    //       might never clear, and waiting out the full deadline with the
    //       player already in the world and frozen would be its own bug.
    //    3. the deadline - 210s, past the longest video (zm_tomb_load, 196.2s).

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User, 2026-09-03, with a screenshot of the Pack-a-Punched Zap Guns: both
//  halves are drawing their STOCK BO1 base textures and no Pack-a-Punch camo.
//  That much is measured, not guessed - the two colour maps were pulled out of
//  mod.iwd and converted (~-gt5_weapon_zom_moon_raygun_front_clr is the blue
//  half with the atom decal, _rear_c is the red half with the "07"), and they
//  are pixel-for-pixel what the screenshot shows.
//
//  THE ENTIRE ASSET CHAIN WAS THEN VERIFIED AND IS INNOCENT. Every link was
//  dumped out of the SHIPPED mod.ff and checked by hand, so none of it is the
//  suspect any more:
//    - t5_weapn_raygun_moon_front_vm / _rear_vm really do use materials
//      mc/mtl_raygun_moon_front and mc/mtl_raygun_moon_rear (XMODEL_EXPORT
//      dump: MATERIAL 0 of each). They are also the ONLY two materials in the
//      whole of mod.ff built on a _dlc5 techset, so nothing else can be meant.
//    - camo_microwavegun carries 13 camoMaterials and slots 3 / 8 / 12 (camo
//      index 39 / 44 / 48) are all live and each maps BOTH gun materials.
//    - the three camo materials those slots name - mtl_weapon_camo_zombies,
//      mtl_weapon_camo_zmb_dlc2, mtl_weapon_camo_3layer - are all in mod.ff, so
//      they resolve on Nuketown, which owns only the first of the three.
//    - camo_microwavegun exists in NO retail fastfile, so the "map's copy wins"
//      ceiling of ERROR_CATALOGUE 50 cannot apply to it.
//  So on Nuketown a camo index of EITHER 44 or 39 had a live slot to land on
//  and a material to swap to, and nothing was drawn. The break is not in the
//  assets, which is why this ships a probe instead of an asset change.
//
//  WHAT THE PROBE SEPARATES, in one line at the moment the options are built:
//    upgraded=0            is_weapon_upgraded() said no, so the camo index is
//                          FORCED to 0 and no camo was ever possible. That is a
//                          real and now-fixed defect for two of the three
//                          upgraded Wave Gun forms (zapgun.gsc, v2.11.3) - but
//                          the form the user was holding, microwavegundw_-
//                          upgraded_zm, IS registered and should print
//                          upgraded=1, so it does NOT explain the screenshot.
//    upgraded=1, index=44  the script did everything right and the engine did
//    (or 39), options!=0   not draw it, so the fault is below GSC: either
//                          Plutonium raw weapons\zm\ loader does not resolve a
//                          def camo field, or a dual-wield / alt form does not
//                          inherit its parent weapon options.
//
//  THE ONE-BOOT EXPERIMENT THAT DECIDES IT: in a single game, .pack an ORDINARY
//  box gun (an AK-74u, say - mod.ff owns its def) and then .pack the Zap Guns,
//  and compare. If the ordinary gun shows the camo and the Zap Guns do not,
//  while BOTH print upgraded=1 with the same camo index, then the difference is
//  the raw-def route itself - which would also mean the 13 guns v2.11.0 moved
//  onto weapons\zm\ lost their camo, and that is the next thing to fix. If
//  neither shows it, the camo option itself is off, or index 44 is not landing
//  where ERROR_CATALOGUE 50 concluded.
//
//  Capped at 24 lines a session and one per weapon name, so packing through a
//  whole game cannot flood the log. Delete this function and its two call sites
//  once the question is answered.

//  qol_health_hud_create / _destroy  -  ALLOCATE ON DEMAND
//
//  🛑 THIS IS A CLIENT HUD-ELEMENT BUDGET FIX, not a cosmetic change.
//  A client has a fixed hudelem allowance. These five were created once at
//  spawn and kept FOREVER, with hud_health_bar only ever writing their .alpha -
//  so switching the health bar off hid it but freed nothing, and the documented
//  workaround ("set hud_health_bar 0 to free 5 slots") did not actually work.
//
//  What that budget starves is anything stock creates ON DEMAND. Origins'
//  generator capture ring is the visible case: it is built when you walk up to
//  a generator and silently is not built when the pool is empty, which is why
//  some generators show the ring and others do not - it was never per-generator.
//
//  qol_opt_zone_hud() in qol_options.gsc already worked this way; the health bar
//  simply never got the same treatment. Both helpers are idempotent so the loop
//  can call them every tick without churn.
//
//  🛑 v1.96.0 - THE NUMERIC READOUT AND THE "+" ARE GONE. THREE ELEMENTS, NOT FIVE.
//
//  User, 2026-08-16, reporting for a friend whose name is "SugarButterBuns":
//  *"his username was long enough to the point that it overlapped with the +
//  symbol next to the 100/100 health number display ... get rid of the + symbol
//  and the numbers ... and just keep the bar(s) themself so the username
//  underneath can fully show without any interference."*
//
//  🌟 THE OVERLAP IS ARITHMETIC, NOT A GUESS. All three sat on the SAME ROW
//  (y = 18 off BOTTOM_LEFT): the name ran rightwards from x = -45, the "+" was
//  pinned LEFT at x = 12 and the "100 / 100" was pinned RIGHT at x = 58. So the
//  name had exactly 57 units of clear space and every name wider than that ran
//  into the "+". Nothing scaled it or clipped it - a hudelem fontstring does
//  neither - so a long name simply drew over the top.
//
//  Deleting the two readouts is what the user asked for and it also settles the
//  general case: the name row is now the full width of the screen edge to
//  wherever it ends, for ANY name length, instead of being correct up to 57
//  units and broken past it.
//
//  📝 A SIDE BENEFIT THAT MATTERS HERE: this hands TWO client hudelem slots per
//  player back to the pool. That is the same budget Origins' generator capture
//  ring allocates out of - see the note above and .agents/checkpoint_48.md §1.

//  zmqol_perf_probe  -  A DIAGNOSTIC SWITCH, NOT A FEATURE          (v1.65.4)
//
//  User, 2026-08-11: *"its still framey as hell, started happening with the mod
//  earlier i just wasnt sure"* - after v1.65.3 removed three sources of redundant
//  per-tick HUD traffic and it made no difference.
//
//  🛑 THIS SHIPS INSTEAD OF A THIRD GUESS. Two rounds of "likely cause" have not
//  moved it, and stacking a third unverified fix is exactly what
//  .agents\QUEUE.md's one-at-a-time rule exists to prevent. CLAUDE.md's
//  pre-mortem section prescribes the alternative directly: *"If something
//  genuinely cannot be settled offline, ship a probe that distinguishes the
//  outcomes rather than a fix built on the likeliest one."*
//
//  WHAT IT DOES. `qol_perf_probe 1` puts EVERY always-on per-player loop this mod
//  runs to sleep and stops its per-bullet HUD work:
//      first_spawn              health bar/text   10Hz  (elements destroyed)
//      zombiecounter            zombie count       4Hz
//      shield_hud               shield value      20Hz
//      zmqol_perk_slot_watcher  perk slots        20Hz
//      updatedamagefeedback     hitmarkers        PER DAMAGE EVENT
//  Nothing else in the mod changes - perks, power-ups, weapons, the Wunderfizz
//  and every gameplay hook keep running exactly as they do now.
//
//  🌟 WHY THIS IS WORTH A SESSION: IT HALVES THE SEARCH SPACE EITHER WAY.
//      still framey with it ON  -> the mod's per-frame SCRIPTS are not the cause,
//                                  and the whole HUD/reliable-command theory is
//                                  dead. Look at mod.ff instead: 3,870 assets and
//                                  776 header-only images that load ahead of every
//                                  map, or the 48MB sound bank.
//      smooth with it ON        -> it IS the scripts, and the five loops above
//                                  are the entire remaining suspect list.
//
//  It reads the dvar live, so it can be toggled mid-game from the console with no
//  map reload: `qol_perf_probe 1` / `qol_perf_probe 0`.
//
//  📝 Default 0. getdvarintdefault() handles the dvar being absent, so nothing
//  needs registering and a player who never types it is unaffected.
//  📝 REMOVE THIS once the cause is known - it is scaffolding, not a setting, and
//  it is deliberately not in the README or the options menu.

//  SHIELD HUD - NOW A WHITE BAR STACKED ON THE PLAYER BAR      (v1.75.0)
//
//  User, 2026-08-11: *"move the sheild health counter as another white health
//  bar above the player health bar, stacked on top fitting perfectly and the
//  same height and length, literally a duplicate bar but white and for the
//  shield not the player."*
//
//  🌟 THIS ALSO CLOSES THE "STRAY VULTURE AID ICON" REPORT - THEY WERE THE SAME
//  ELEMENT. The screenshot's detached low-centre icon is not Vulture Aid: it is
//  THIS function's shield icon, and on TranZit it was drawn with the
//  "damage_feedback" shader (the hitmarker), which is why it read as a stray
//  crest nobody could place. It was also positioned with nonsense values -
//  alignx/aligny are STRING alignment fields ("left"/"middle"/...) and this set
//  them to the numbers 240 and 460, so the element landed wherever the engine
//  fell back to. Both the icon and the centre number are gone now; the bar
//  replaces them.
//
//  🌟 EVERY DIMENSION IS COPIED FROM qol_health_hud_create(), NOT HAND-TUNED,
//  exactly as asked. Background "white" 104x5 at x -45; fill "progress_bar_fill"
//  100x3 at x -43; same alignx/aligny/horzalign/vertalign; same sort order.
//  The ONLY differences are y and colour.
//
//  THE Y VALUE IS DERIVED, NOT GUESSED. Measured from the three elements that
//  already share this corner: zombie counter y = -7, player bar y = 7, player
//  name y = 18 - and in the screenshot they render top-to-bottom in that order,
//  which proves positive y is DOWNWARD here. The player bar's background is 5
//  tall with aligny "middle", so it spans 4.5..9.5; a bar of the same height
//  sitting flush on top of it has its centre at 4.5 - 2.5 = 2. Hence y = 2, and
//  it lands in the gap that already exists between the counter and the bar.
//
//  🌟 ALLOCATE-ON-DEMAND, the same pattern and for the same reason as
//  qol_health_hud_create/_destroy above: a client has a fixed hudelem
//  allowance, and the old code held its two elements for the whole match even
//  with no shield. Now nothing is allocated until a shield is actually carried,
//  so this is a NET REDUCTION in held elements for most of a game, not an
//  increase - which matters while the frametime complaint is still open.
//
//  📝 2300 is carried over verbatim from the previous implementation, as is the
//  three-weapon check. Neither is re-tuned here.
//  📝 The two zm_riotshield_* precacheshader calls are left in place: they cost
//  one asset slot each and removing a precache is a bigger change than leaving
//  a dormant one.

        //  🛑 v2.13.0 - THE CO-OP CRASH. THE FLAG IS CLAIMED *BEFORE* THE WAIT,
        //  AND THAT ONE LINE IS THE WHOLE FIX.
        //
        //  This is a PER-PLAYER thread (dm_onplayerconnect threads one per
        //  player), and it installed a LEVEL-WIDE hook. The guard tested
        //  level.deathmachine_powerup_init_done and only set it AFTER `wait 2`,
        //  so in co-op every player's thread passed the test inside the same
        //  window - they all spawn together at match start - and every one of
        //  them then ran the install block.
        //
        //  🌟 WHY THAT CRASHES, EXACTLY. The block saves the current handler and
        //  then overwrites it:
        //        level.original_deathmachine_powerup_grab = level._zombiemode_powerup_grab;
        //        level._zombiemode_powerup_grab           = ::custom_powerup_grab;
        //  The FIRST thread saves the real handler (stock's, or the map's own -
        //  Origins' ::tomb_powerup_grab). The SECOND thread, resuming from its
        //  own wait a frame later, saves what the first one just installed:
        //  ::custom_powerup_grab ITSELF. So original == custom.
        //
        //  custom_powerup_grab()'s last line chains the saved handler:
        //        level thread [[ level.original_deathmachine_powerup_grab ]]( ... );
        //  which is now itself. Picking up ANY power-up that is not the Death
        //  Machine or Zombie Blood - Max Ammo, Nuke, Insta-Kill, Carpenter,
        //  Double Points, Fire Sale - therefore spawns a thread that spawns a
        //  thread that spawns a thread, with no wait anywhere in the chain, and
        //  the server dies on the spot. Two players is enough; solo can never
        //  reach it because there is only ever one thread.
        //
        //  🌟 THE FIX IS ATOMIC BECAUSE GSC IS COOPERATIVE. There is no
        //  preemption between the isDefined test and the assignment below - a
        //  thread only yields at a wait - so exactly one player's thread can
        //  ever win the claim, and the losers skip the block entirely. The
        //  `wait 2` still happens inside the winner, so the map's own handler is
        //  still in place before it is chained; only the bookkeeping moved.

//                         upgraded on the spot)

//                         goes INTO the machine, the machine works, the upgraded
//                         gun pops out and you walk up and take it.
//
//  🌟 Stock mode is stock's real code, not a re-creation of it. Nothing here
//  reimplements the machine - the mod only decides which trigger is standing.
//
//  🛑 trigger_on()/trigger_off() (common_scripts\utility) move a trigger 10000
//  units down and remember `realorigin`. Stock's own enable_trigger()/
//  disable_trigger() (_zm_utility) do the SAME 10000-unit move through a
//  DIFFERENT field, `.disabled`. Handing the machine over while stock has its
//  trigger sunk mid-upgrade would make trigger_off() record the sunken origin as
//  `realorigin`, and the following trigger_on() would restore the trigger to
//  underground - dead for the rest of the match. That is why the watcher below
//  refuses to switch while either side is mid-upgrade.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

//  whether stock's trigger is down because of us. Without it this would happily
//  trigger_on() a stock trigger that stock itself had turned off for its own

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User, 2026-09-01: at high FOV the character's left hand floats in view while
//  the Ray Gun is held. Measured before writing this: the floating hand is the
//  player's view-arms model posed by viewmodel_raygun_t6_idle, NOT part of the
//  gun (t6_wpn_zmb_raygun_view's glb dump holds only gun bones - j_gun,
//  tag_battery_*, no arm geometry), and stock hideTags only ever hide gun parts
//  (sights/rails/mags - surveyed across every zm_nuked.ff weapon def). A true
//  fix means re-authoring the xanim, and no tool that can do that exists - the
//  same tooling wall as the Winter's Howl frozen pose.
//
//  What CAN move is the whole viewmodel: cg_gun_ofs_f/r/u exist in this game's
//  own dvar dump (all 0 stock). They are client dvars, driven here through
//  setclientdvar exactly like the FOG row drives cheat-protected r_fog. Whether
//  the renderer still honours them is the one thing not answerable offline -
//  which is why this ships as a TUNABLE, OFF BY DEFAULT:
//
//      zmqol_raygun_hand_ofs "0 0 0"     (forward right up; "0 0 0" = stock)
//
//  Set it at the console while holding a Ray Gun and the offsets apply live;
//  switch guns and they reset to 0. Once values that hide the hand are known
//  they become the shipped default. If no values change anything on screen,
//  the lever is dead and the honest answer is "engine limit" - either way the
//  boot settles it.
//
//  v2.9.34 - the front-end is now the `.rayhand` chat command (a preset
//  cycler; see its branch in the command dispatcher), because vector-typing
//  at the console went unused for two sessions on a pad. This watch is

//  zmqol_dof_fix  -  DEPTH OF FIELD "DISABLED" was not actually disabled
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Item 48. Found via the 2026-08-26 boot report (checkpoint 110 §4): the
//  ADVANCED tab's DEPTH OF FIELD row (dof_quality) only ever writes CLIENT
//  dvars (r_dof_enable / r_dofHDR - see QolDofCallback in optionssettings.lua).
//  Stock calls the engine method setdepthoffield() directly from SERVER-side
//  GSC in several places, completely independent of those client dvars, and
//  a scripted blur curve from the server overrides the renderer's own
//  r_dof_enable state.
//
//  🌟 EVERY REAL CALLER, MEASURED against the stock dump
//  (t6 modding starter kit\reference\gsc-dump\ZM\Core), not assumed:
//    _zm.gsc::onplayerconnect_clientdvars() / onplayerspawned(), and
//    _globallogic_spawn.gsc's per-player respawn path - all already call
//        setdepthoffield( 0, 0, ... ), the "no blur" tuple. Nothing to fix.
//    _globallogic_spawn.gsc::spawnintermission()            - REAL BLUR
//        ( 0, 128, ... ). Every round-end / match-end intermission spawn.
//    _globallogic_spawn.gsc::spawninterroundintermission()  - REAL BLUR, but
//        has NO CALLER anywhere in the whole ZM script dump (an MP-gametype
//        leftover) - confirmed by a directory-wide grep, not a single missed
//        file. Unreachable in zombies, so left alone.
//    _globallogic.gsc::roundenddof()                        - REAL BLUR.
//        Threaded once per player from endgame() at round/match end - the
//        "game-over sequence" from the checkpoint's own diagnosis.
//    _zm.gsc::set_third_person() and
//    _globallogic_spawn.gsc::setthirdperson()                - REAL BLUR in
//        their "on" branches, but BOTH are unreached on this platform: the
//        second opens with `if ( !level.console ) return;` (console-only,
//        dead on Plutonium PC), and the first's only caller anywhere in the
//        dump, spectator_toggle_3rd_person(), itself has NO caller anywhere
//        in the dump either - same whole-dump grep. 🛑 NOT FIXED, and not
//        guessed at: nothing found here justifies shipping a change for a
//        path nothing can reach. If blur is ever seen while toggling
//        third-person spectator view, this is the first place to look.
//
//  🛑 WHY NEITHER TRUE CALLER CAN BE replaceFunc'D - VERIFIED, NOT ASSUMED
//  (starter-kit replaceFunc failure mode 1 - unqualified same-file call):
//    - roundenddof() is invoked as `player thread roundenddof(4.0);` from
//      INSIDE _globallogic.gsc itself (endgame(), same file, unqualified) -
//      a replaceFunc on it would never see that call.
//    - endgame(), the function that calls it, is ~150 lines of real,
//      safety-critical branching (ranked-match promotion popups, next-round
//      vs match-end, exitlevel) reached from EIGHT call sites across three
//      files - and TWO of those eight (_globallogic.gsc:365 and :397) are
//      themselves unqualified same-file calls. Replicating all 150 lines by
//      hand would still only redirect 6 of 8 paths - a worse, silently
//      partial fix - and hand-copying match-ending logic is exactly the
//      kind of guess this project does not ship.
//
//  🌟 THE FIX THAT ACTUALLY COVERS EVERY PATH: `level notify( "game_ended" )`
//  fires unconditionally inside endgame() (_globallogic.gsc:1086), BEFORE
//  its roundenddof() calls, on every one of the eight paths that can reach
//  endgame() - so a level-notify watcher catches all of them uniformly,
//  where no replaceFunc could. This is a ONE-SHOT correction keyed to a real
//  engine event, not a per-frame fight against the renderer - the earlier
//  "not the watcher-mitigation fallback" instruction was about a continuous
//  poll overriding the engine every frame; this fires once, after the one
//  real event that can add the blur, with a short wait to land after it.
//
//  spawnintermission() IS reachable cleanly: every one of its 5 call sites
//  goes through the `level.spawnintermission` FUNCTION POINTER, never called
//  by name directly (failure mode 3 - re-point, don't replaceFunc), so
//  zmqol_dof_repoint_spawnintermission() waits for stock to set that pointer
//  (in map init) and then takes it over. The wrapper calls stock's real
//  function FIRST, by its qualified name (not through the pointer, so no
//  recursion), letting every branch of stock's own logic - including the
//  ranked-match promotion popup loop - run completely untouched, then
//  corrects only the trailing DOF call. Nothing about stock's control flow
//  is replicated or guessed at.
//
//  Both fixes are additive-only when the row is not DISABLED: dof_quality
//  != 0 skips the correction in both places and stock's blur plays exactly
//  as before, so LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH keep working unchanged.

//  FIELD: DISABLED: *"i can still see depth of field when aiming/zooming in,
//  make sure that when it's set to disabled it actually disables all the depth
//  of field as intended."*
//
//  🌟 THE CAUSE, READ OUT OF THEIR OWN CONFIG RATHER THAN GUESSED.
//  storage	6\players\mods\zm_qol\plutonium_zm.cfg contains
//      seta dof_quality "0"
//      seta r_dofHDR    "2"
//  and NO r_dof_enable line at all. Plutonium does not archive that dvar. So on
//  every fresh launch:
//      dof_quality      comes back 0  -> the row correctly displays DISABLED
//      r_dof_enable     is the ENGINE DEFAULT, which is 1 -> blur is on
//  and the only thing that ever wrote r_dof_enable was QolDofCallback in
//  optionssettings.lua, which runs only when someone actually moves the
//  selector. Leave the row alone - as anyone who has already set it to DISABLED
//  would - and it is never written. The row was telling the truth about the
//  mod's own dvar and nothing had told the renderer.
//
//  🛑 v1.99.54 DELIBERATELY REMOVED THE CONNECT-TIME WRITE, and its reasoning
//  ("that row is the single owner of r_dof_enable now") had one hole: a menu row
//  can only own a value while the menu is open. Its own comment claimed "the mod
//  has archived r_dof_enable at 0 in the player's config since v1.99.45" - the
//  config above shows that is no longer true, which is why this is fixed by
//  measuring the file rather than by trusting the comment.
//
//  🌟 THE SHAPE IS FOG'S, WHICH ALREADY WORKS. v1.99.91 hit exactly this for
//  r_fog - cheat-protected, never archived - and solved it by making an ordinary
//  mod dvar the source of truth and carrying it to the renderer on connect plus
//  on change. dof_quality is already that dvar, so this is the same two-part
//  fix: apply it on connect, and watch it for changes. Nothing about the row,
//  its four choices, or their meanings changes.
//
//  📝 r_dof_tweak IS SET TO 0 AND THAT IS NOT DEFENSIVE PADDING. Plutonium's own
//  dvar_descriptions.json documents it as *"Use dvars to set the depth of field
//  effect; overrides r_dof_enable"* - it is the one documented way for
//  r_dof_enable 0 to be ignored, so a disable that does not clear it is not a
//  disable. Nothing in this mod turns it on; this makes sure nothing else can
//  leave it on either.
//
//  📝 dof_quality 0 = DISABLED, 1/2/3 = LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH, and r_dofHDR wants
//  0/1/2 for those three - the same mapping QolDofSettings uses in the Lua, kept
//  identical on purpose so the two front-ends can never disagree.

//    covers every perk on every map with nothing to keep in sync and it follows
//    MOVING machines (Die Rise elevator perks). See the long note above
//    prone_bonus_try_award() for why the old hand-written name list is gone.
//
//  Origins (zm_tomb):
//    Origins has this feature NATIVELY (the "loose change" easter egg). We do
//    NOT run our detection there (init() skips pbp_onplayerconnect on
//    zm_tomb, above). Bumping that native 25 -> 100 is done in

//    the Origins map script (root scripts load on EVERY map and would throw
//    "unresolved external" elsewhere).
//
//  Switch: `perk_bonus_points` (GAME tab row PERK BONUS POINTS, default ON).
//  OFF means NO prone points anywhere, Origins' native 25 included - the user
//  asked for exactly two states, 100-per-machine or nothing.

// ============================================================================
//  🛑 v1.99.61 - REWRITTEN. THE NAME LIST IS GONE, AND IT WAS THE BUG.
//
//  Two faults were reported on 2026-08-18 and both trace to the same thing:
//  this used to enumerate SIXTEEN hand-written `vending_*` names and, for each,
//  take getentarray(name,"target") AND getentarray(name,"targetname"), then
//  dedupe by name. A hand-written list of engine tags is a guess with extra
//  steps, and it drifted from the game in both directions at once.
//
//    * DEADSHOT PAID TWICE (Bus Depot, user screenshot). Stock tags Deadshot
//      ASYMMETRICALLY - `_zm_perks.gsc:3050-3051` sets use_trigger.target =
//      "vending_deadshot" and perk_machine.targetname = "vending_deadshot_model".
//      Those are two DIFFERENT strings, so the trigger and the model landed in
//      two different dedupe buckets and one machine paid 100 twice. Every other
//      perk uses one string for both, which is why only Deadshot did this.
//
//    * MOB'S ELECTRIC CHERRY PAID NOTHING. Its model tag is
//      "vendingelectric_cherry" - no underscore after "vending"
//      (`_zm_perk_electric_cherry.gsc:65`) - and it was never in the list.
//
//  🌟 THE FIX IS TO STOP GUESSING TAGS AND ASK THE GAME. Every perk machine on
//  every map is built by `_zm_perks::perk_machine_spawn_init()`, which at
//  :2878 sets ONE universal handle on the use trigger:
//
//        use_trigger.targetname   = "zombie_vending"
//        use_trigger.script_noteworthy = <the specialty_ name>
//        use_trigger.machine      = <the perk model>            (:2905)
//
//  ...BEFORE the per-perk switch and before any custom perk's
//  perk_machine_set_kvps callback runs, and no callback in the game overwrites
//  it (checked: Electric Cherry's does not). It is the same handle stock's own
//  `_zm_perks::init`, `_zm_power`, `_zm_hackables_perks`, zm_prison, zm_highrise
//  and zm_buried_sq all use to find perk machines. Die Rise and Nuketown reroute
//  through `level.override_perk_targetname` but still land in the same function,
//  so they are covered too.
//
//  Consequences worth stating:
//    - EXACTLY ONE ENTITY PER MACHINE, so double-paying is now structurally
//      impossible and the 128-unit dedupe radius that used to cost Mule Kick its
//      points on Farm is gone entirely rather than merely narrowed.
//    - EVERY perk is covered automatically, including ones this mod has not
//      added yet. Nothing to keep in sync.
//    - Die Rise's elevator perks: the trigger is `linkto`'d to the machine and
//      the machine to the elevator (`zm_highrise_elevators.gsc:853-873`), so the
//      origin read here follows a moving machine on its own.
//    - Pack-a-Punch is excluded by script_noteworthy, which is how stock tells
//      it apart at `_zm_perks.gsc:38`.
//
//  🌟 ONE AWARD PER MACHINE PER MATCH, LEVEL-SCOPED - and that is not a choice,
//  it is what stock does. Origins' own "loose change" easter egg
//  (`zm_tomb_ee_side::check_for_change`) threads one loop per machine and
//  `break`s after the first successful prone, so the machine pays once to
//  whichever player got there first and never again. The claim is therefore
//  stored ON THE MACHINE (trig.zmqol_prone_paid), not on the player: it cannot
//  be farmed by a second player, cannot be re-earned after a down, and survives
//  the machine moving.

// spawnteddybear() / setteddybears() reworked 2026-07-26 against the stock
// zm_transit.gsc reference (maps\mp\zm_transit.gsc :: sndsetupmusiceasteregg /
// sndmusicegg / sndplaymusicegg - the native Tranzit "3 teddy bears -> secret
// song" easter egg, which only ever runs in zclassic mode; this is a
// zstandard-only reimplementation with its own local per-start-zone origins):
//   - teddymodel now plays a "zmb_meteor_loop" beacon so players can hear a
//     bear before they see it (stock does this on its own helper entity).
//   - the 3-bear count is now a LEVEL-scoped counter (level.sss_teddybear_count),
//     not a per-player one - matching stock's level.meteor_counter so co-op
//     players collectively complete it, and so a single player triggering all
//     3 actually reaches 3 (the old i.teddybears was already correct for solo
//     play; the real reason the song never played is the missing loop below).
//   - the secret song now plays via a dedicated threaded function mirroring
//     stock's sndplaymusicegg(), instead of a bare playsound() call inline.
// v1.67.1: pitch and roll are OPTIONAL trailing parameters. The teddy bear model
// has no sitting pose - it is a single rigid stand-up mesh - so "sitting on a
// shelf" can only be done by laying it over, which needs roll. Town, Bus Depot
// and Farm all call this with four arguments, so both default to 0 and their
// bears are bit-for-bit unchanged.
//
// 📝 The model measures 26.1 tall (y -3.46..22.66 in its GLB), 10.6 across and
// 17.4 deep, read from the bounding box in zombie_teddybear_lod0.glb rather than
// estimated. Rolled onto its side the 5.32 half-width becomes the lowest point
// instead of the 3.46 base, so a laid-down bear sinks ~1.9 units - which is why
// the Diner z values below are lifted a few units rather than reused as-is.
// v1.67.4: `snap` is a fourth optional parameter. When set, the bear's HEIGHT is
// measured in game with a downward bullettrace instead of being supplied, and z
// becomes only a starting guess. Three rounds of "still floating" on the shelf
// bear is three rounds too many - the engine knows exactly where that board is
// and script can just ask it.
//
// 🛑 IT FAILS SAFE. Two ways the trace can mislead, both rejected rather than
// trusted: no hit at all (fraction 1, e.g. a decorative shelf with no
// collision), or a hit far below the seed - which would mean it punched through
// the shelf and found the floor, dropping the bear to ground level. Either way
// the supplied z is kept, so the worst case is exactly the behaviour before this
// change. Which branch ran is printed, so one boot says whether the surface is
// solid.
// ============================================================================
//  zm_qol: LIVE BEAR TUNING  -  `zmqol_bear_live 1`                (v1.67.8)
//
//  🛑 THIS EXISTS BECAUSE SEVEN ROUNDS OF INFERRING A POSITION FROM SCREENSHOTS
//  IS SEVEN TOO MANY. Every placement so far has been me reading an arrow in an
//  image, converting it to a bearing, and shipping a build - and the shelf bear
//  has now cost six of them. The dvars were meant to avoid that but still need a
//  match restart to take effect, because setteddybears() reads them once.
//
//  With `zmqol_bear_live 1` a tagged bear re-reads its six dvars four times a
//  second and moves immediately, so the console becomes a direct manipulator:
//
//      zmqol_bear_live 1
//      zmqol_bear2_diner_yaw 200      <- the bear turns as you type it
//      zmqol_bear2_diner_x -4838
//
//  Dial it until it looks right, read the numbers back, and they become the
//  defaults. No build, no restart, no more arrows.
//
//  Default OFF, so a normal game never runs the loop. Only the three Diner bears
//  pass a tune id at all - Town, Bus Depot and Farm cannot reach this code.
//  📝 REMOVE once the Diner placements are settled; this is scaffolding.

            //  That last one was worth checking rather than trusting: the song
            //  is in NO transit bank, classic or survival. It resolves only
            //  because patch_zm carries it - as "carrion", TranZit's own secret
            //  song. Diner therefore gets the same track as Bus Depot, Farm and

//  runs:
//      !p <amount>   give yourself that many points (default 1000 if the amount
//                    is missing or not a number). Negative values are allowed so
//                    you can take points away too.
//      !god          toggle invulnerability on/off, with feedback either way.
//
//  sv_cheats is forced to 1 here so the commands behave consistently and the
//  usual Plutonium console cheats keep working alongside them.
//
//  Mechanism: T6 fires a level notify "say" carrying the speaker and the raw
//  message. Verified against a known-working release rather than guessed -
//  H:\Claude\BO2-GSC-Releases\Zombies Mods\Give Points Command uses exactly
//  level waittill( "say", player, message ). Builtins used were checked against
//  the stock dump too: enableinvulnerability/disableinvulnerability appear in
//  _hostmigration.gsc and add_to_player_score is _zm_score.gsc:311. iprintlnbold
//  is used for feedback because tell() does not exist in T6.
//
//  This lives in quality_of_life.gsc (a ROOT script) so it is available on every
//  map, and every reference is to a core script, so AI_CONTEXT rule 2 is safe.

//  🛑 THE USER'S PREMISE WAS HALF RIGHT AND THE HALF THAT IS WRONG MATTERS.
//  User, 2026-08-18: *"i set my character as cia in the pre game menu for
//  nuketown, it worked and im the cia player model, but when i open the
//  scoreboard it says CDC which obviously makes no sense"*. It IS wrong on
//  screen - but the mod did not cause it, and stock does exactly the same thing
//  whenever its own random roll picks CIA. Proof, not opinion:
//
//      maps\mp\gametypes_zm\_scoreboard.gsc:17-21
//          if ( sessionmodeiszombiesgame() )
//          {
//              setdvar( "g_TeamIcon_Axis",   "faction_cia" );
//              setdvar( "g_TeamIcon_Allies", "faction_cdc" );
//          }
//
//  In zombies that pair is HARDCODED - the `game["icons"][...]` values the
//  teamset script sets up (_teamset_cdc.gsc:24,36) are read only on the MP
//  branch. Every zombies player is on `allies`, so the scoreboard emblem is
//  faction_cdc on every map, in every mode, no matter which model you wear.
//  zm_nuked.gsc:41-44 rolls `should_use_cia` at random, so a STOCK Nuketown
//  game shows a CIA player under a CDC emblem about half the time.
//
//  🌟 THE FIX IS ONE DVAR, AND IT IS THE ONE STOCK ALREADY TRUSTS. The material
//  is not in doubt either: stock itself writes "faction_cia" into
//  g_TeamIcon_Axis two lines above, in the same zombies branch, so the asset is
//  loaded and valid. All this does is point the ALLIES icon at whichever
//  faction the level actually dressed the players in.
//
//  level.should_use_cia is the single source of that answer on every CDC/CIA
//  map in the game - zm_buried:60, zm_nuked:41, zm_tomb:72, zm_transit:89,
//  zm_transit_dr:59 - and it is the same variable the lobby CHARACTER picker
//  writes (qol_options.gsc), so the emblem tracks the picker for free.
//
//  🛑 GRIEF AND CLEANSED ARE EXCLUDED, DELIBERATELY. Those modes have two real
//  player teams: allies IS CDC and axis IS CIA, and the stock pair is correct.
//  Repointing the allies icon there would put a CIA emblem on both teams.
//
//  It re-checks rather than firing once, because the picker can change teams
//  from the lobby row mid-session and because _scoreboard::init() must have run
//  first - it would otherwise overwrite this.

//  (`level waittill( "say", message, player )`). So every command, every alias
//  and every future addition is reachable from the console the moment it works
//  in chat, and the two lists can never drift because there is only one list.
//
//  🛑 HOW YOU ACTUALLY TYPE IT, AND WHY. GSC cannot register a real console
//  COMMAND - the only lever it has is a dvar. So each command name is registered
//  as a dvar and ANY non-empty value fires it:
//        round 100     ->  .round 100
//        p 5000        ->  .p 5000

//                                          just prints the dvar, as dvars do)
//  This is the same shape as `fly`, which the user already uses, so it is the
//  established pattern here rather than a new convention.
//
//  🛑 THE NAMES WERE CHECKED FOR COLLISIONS, NOT ASSUMED SAFE. Every command
//  name below was diffed against the 3,210 dvars this install actually dumps
//  into console_zm.log. Exactly one matched - `fly` - and that one is this mod's
//  own, already registered by qol_options with its own watcher. It is therefore
//  DELIBERATELY ABSENT from the list: clearing it to "" every pass would break
//  the watcher that owns it. Everything else is a name the engine does not use.
//
//  📝 `qol` takes a whole command line, which covers the alias families that are
//  matched by prefix rather than by name - the per-perk `.givejug` /
//  `.removecherry` forms and the power-up aliases:
//        qol "givejug"      qol "maxammo"      qol "powerup nuke"
//
//  ⚠️ Each pass reads one dvar per name, 4 times a second. That is ~150 hash
//  lookups/sec and nothing else - no allocation, no per-player work. Listed here

//  🛑 level._custom_perks IS NOT THE PERK LIST. Both commands used to walk only
//  that array, and the user's report shows exactly what that costs:
//  ".removeperks ... said it removed 2 perks but i still have 7". T6 keeps perks
//  in two places and _custom_perks is the smaller one:
//
//    - the NINE core perks are flags:  level.zombiemode_using_<name>_perk.
//      _zm_perks::init() turns each on with its own turn_<name>_on() thread and
//      never puts them in _custom_perks (see _zm_perks.gsc:75-99, where the core
//      perks are nine explicit if-blocks and the _custom_perks loop is separate).
//    - only perks registered through register_perk_basic_info land in
//      _custom_perks: Electric Cherry, PhD Flopper, Vulture Aid.
//
//  So on a map with two customs it removed two and left the seven core ones -
//  precisely what was reported. zmqol_map_perks() below reads BOTH, and is the
//  same enumeration wunderfizz.gsc::getPerks() already uses to decide what the
//  machine may hand out, so the two agree on what "every perk on this map"
//  means.
//
//  give_perk( perk, bought ) is the stock entry point (_zm_perks.gsc:1982), and
//  is also the function this mod already replaceFuncs for the perk pop-up HUD,
//  so perks handed out here animate and count exactly like bought ones.
//
//  🛑 REMOVAL IS A NOTIFY, NOT A CALL. There is no stock "remove a perk"
//  function - unsetperk() sits inside perk_think(), which is a waiting loop:
//        perk_str = perk + "_stop";
//        result = self waittill_any_return( "fake_death", "death",
//                                           "player_downed", perk_str );
//  Notifying "<perk>_stop" is therefore the supported way out, and it runs the
//  whole stock teardown - unsetperk, num_perks--, and the per-perk switch that
//  puts Juggernog's max health back. Calling unsetperk() directly would skip all
//  of that and leave the player on 250 health with no Jugg.
// ============================================================================
//  Every perk this map actually has: the nine core flags plus whatever is in
//  level._custom_perks. Mirrors wunderfizz.gsc::getPerks(), minus its Buried
//  PhD exclusion - that exists because Buried's Wunderfizz must not OFFER a perk
//  the map cannot support, which is not a reason to refuse to strip it if the
//  player somehow has it.

//  .give<perk> / .remove<perk>  -  one perk at a time
//
//  Parsed as a PREFIX rather than 24 explicit commands, so ".givejug" and
//  ".removejug" come out of the same two blocks in the chat handler. The alias
//  table below is deliberately generous - the whole point is not having to
//  remember whether it is "stam" or "staminup" mid-round.
//
//  🛑 THE SPECIALTY NAMES ARE THE TRAP, NOT THE ALIASES. Several read like the
//  wrong perk and models routinely guess them backwards, so they are taken from
//  getPerkName() below, which is already the shipped mapping:
//      specialty_armorvest              Jugger-Nog       (NOT flak/armor)
//      specialty_rof                    Double Tap 2.0
//      specialty_longersprint           Stamin-Up        (NOT marathon-the-perk)
//      specialty_additionalprimaryweapon Mule Kick
//      specialty_flakjacket             PhD Flopper      (NOT Jugger-Nog)
//      specialty_scavenger              Tombstone        (NOT a scavenger perk)
//      specialty_finalstand             Who's Who        (NOT last stand)
//      specialty_nomotionsensor         Vulture Aid
//      specialty_grenadepulldeath       Electric Cherry
//
//  Returns undefined for anything unrecognised, which is what lets the chat
//  handler use it as the test for "is this a perk command at all" - so a typo
//  falls through to the normal unknown-command path instead of doing something
//  surprising.
// ============================================================================
// ============================================================================
//  zmqol_ghost_enforce  -  .ghost / .afk stay on until YOU turn them off
//
//  🛑 THE BUG, root-caused rather than guessed. Reported: "ghost is still kinda
//  inconsistent, I find myself having to constantly disable and re-enable it
//  because the zombies will sometimes start targeting me again."
//
//  .ghost sets self.ignoreme = 1 exactly once. Stock sets it back to 0 in at
//  least five places, none of which know this mod exists:
//
//      _zm.gsc:1381  player_spawn_protection()  loops 60 frames setting
//                    ignoreme = 1, then UNCONDITIONALLY ends with ignoreme = 0.
//                    This is the big one - it runs on spawn, so every respawn
//                    silently cancels ghost about three seconds in.
//      _zm.gsc:2598  the respawn path, ignoreme = 0 alongside reviveplayer()
//      _zm_laststand.gsc:445, :984, :1053   revive / laststand exit
//
//  That is the whole symptom: not a flicker, a hard cancel that persists until
//  the command is toggled. Nothing was wrong with the flag itself.
//
//  🌟 WHY THIS RE-ASSERTS INSTEAD OF PATCHING THOSE FIVE SITES. Patching them
//  means either five replaceFuncs on core stock functions or reimplementing
//  player_spawn_protection - and it would only cover the reset paths I managed
//  to find. Re-asserting cannot miss one. It is also strictly safer: every
//  writer above sets ignoreme to a literal, so there is no state to corrupt by
//  writing 1 over it, and stock's own spawn protection is *also* setting it to 1
//  for those three seconds, so the two never disagree while it matters.
//
//  Zombie target selection reads ignoreme live every time it picks - stock
//  _zm.gsc:5105 and _zm_utility::is_player_valid( player, checkignoremeflag )
//  both test the current value - so restoring it within a frame restores the
//  behaviour with it. There is no cached "this zombie has chosen you" state
//  keyed off the old value.
//
//  Self-replacing: the first act is to notify its own endon, so re-issuing
//  .ghost or .afk swaps the thread rather than stacking a second copy. It exits
//  on its own the moment both flags are off, so an un-ghosted player runs
//  nothing.

// ============================================================================
//  🛑 THE give_perk HOOK DOES NOT FIRE. MEASURED, 2026-08-08.
//
//  v1.62.1 tracked acquisition order from inside our give_perk() override. The
//  probe it shipped said, after a ".giveperks" that the log itself records:
//
//      [zm_qol] perk slots: tracked=0 held=12 total=12
//
//  Zero. And .giveperks reaches give_perk by a FULLY QUALIFIED external call
//  (maps\mp\zombies\_zm_perks::give_perk), the case replaceFunc is least
//  supposed to miss - so this is not the unqualified-same-file question at all.
//  replaceFunc( _zm_perks::give_perk, ::give_perk ) in main() simply is not
//  taking, and it never has: our override is byte-equivalent to stock's, so
//  nothing has ever depended on it and nothing ever looked broken.
//
//  📝 That also RETRACTS what v1.62.1's comments inferred from BO2-Reimagined
//  (that a synchronous same-file call is hookable). The inference was reasoned
//  from a shipped mod's design; this is a direct measurement of this mod, and
//  the measurement wins. The hook question is now irrelevant here either way -
//  nothing below reads give_perk.
//
//  🌟 SO ORDER IS OBSERVED, NOT REPORTED. zmqol_perk_slot_watcher() samples the
//  perks the player is holding and maintains the list itself:
//      - a perk that has appeared is APPENDED
//      - a perk that has gone is deleted, PRESERVING ORDER
//  which is exactly what CoD.Perks.Update and CoD.Perks.RemovePerkIcon do to
//  the LUI's slot array. Same two operations, same result, and it cannot miss
//  an acquisition path because it never looks at one.

//  every perk's EFFECT correctly but leaves the HUD showing twelve copies of
//  PhD Flopper. The chat command is the trigger; the defect is stock's, in
//  CoD.Perks.RemovePerkIcon (readable at
//  BO2-Reimagined\ui_mp\t6\zombie\hudperkszombie.lua:170-207, and stock's own
//  bytecode string table confirms the function set is unmodified there):
//
//      local PerkWidget, NextPerkWidget = nil, nil
//      for PerkIndex = OwnedPerkIndex, 12, 1 do
//          PerkWidget = Menu.perks[PerkIndex]
//          if not PerkWidget.perkId then break
//          elseif PerkIndex ~= 12 then
//              NextPerkWidget = Menu.perks[PerkIndex + 1]
//          end                    -- no else: on slot 12 this is still slot 12
//
//  Removing a perk shifts every icon down one slot. On the LAST slot there is
//  no next slot, so NextPerkWidget still points at slot 12 from the previous
//  pass - slot 12 copies ITSELF and never clears. Every removal then duplicates
//  the tail, and once all twelve perkIds are non-nil the row can never be
//  filled or emptied again, so it is stuck until the HUD is rebuilt.
//
//  🌟 THE CONDITION IS NARROW, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS FIXABLE FROM GSC. It fires
//  ONLY when the row is 12/12 full AND the removed perk is below slot 12. With
//  even one slot free the loop reaches the empty slot and clears correctly -
//  that is why stock never sees it, and why this mod does: no perk limit.
//  Two consequences:
//      - removing the perk in slot 12 is always safe (NextPerkWidget is a
//        function-local, freshly nil, so the first pass takes the clear path)
//      - once slot 12 is empty the row is no longer full, so every REMAINING
//        removal is safe in any order
//  So clearing the newest perk first is sufficient. Nothing else here changes.
//
// ============================================================================
//  🛑 v1.62.5 - THE ORDER OF THE NOTIFIES WAS NEVER THE ORDER THE HUD SAW
//
//  Reported back 2026-08-08 after v1.62.2 was confirmed working once: the row
//  still collapses to one icon SOMETIMES (the friend's run showed twelve Vulture
//  Aids). Two measured reasons the notify-ordering alone cannot be enough, both
//  fixed by clearing the clientfields here directly instead:
//
//  1. A NOTIFY IS NOT A WRITE. "<perk>_stop" only wakes perk_think, and what the
//     LUI reacts to is perk_think's set_perk_clientfield( perk, 0 ) further down
//     (_zm_perks.gsc:2204). perk_think returns EARLY - before that write - when
//     self._retain_perks or self._retain_perks_array[perk] is set (2166-2171),
//     which is exactly the Tombstone / Who's Who / afterlife state. A retained
//     perk therefore keeps its icon no matter what order it was notified in, and
//     the row never empties. That is the user's actual request: ".removeperks
//     should also make sure to remove any and all of the perk shaders."
//
//  2. TWELVE WRITES IN ONE FRAME HAVE NO ORDER. Clientfield changes ride one
//     snapshot per server frame, so a batch that lands in a single frame reaches
//     the LUI in the engine's field order, not the script's. Every write below
//     is therefore spaced 0.1s - the same spacing zmqol_give_all_perks() already
//     uses, which is the spacing that produced twelve distinct icons in the
//     user's confirmed v1.62.2 screenshot.
//
//  🌟 WHY THE SWEEP IS SAFE IN ANY ORDER. Stock's off-by-one needs the row to be
//  FULL: with a free slot the loop reaches it and takes the clearing branch. So
//  only the FIRST removal is order-critical, and phase 1 spends it on the last
//  slot. Everything after it runs against a row of at most eleven.
//
//  🛑 set_perk_clientfield IS ONLY CALLED FOR PERKS THIS MAP REGISTERED. Stock
//  registers the twelve fields conditionally (perks_register_clientfield,
//  _zm_perks.gsc:3091, gated on level.zombiemode_using_<perk>_perk, plus each
//  custom perk's own clientfield_register), and zmqol_map_perks() reads those
//  same flags and the same level._custom_perks keys - so the two lists are the
//  same list. Anything outside it is left alone rather than written blind.
//
//  ⚠️ STILL NOT COVERED, and not claimed to be: going down while holding all
//  twelve. Who's Who's revive and Mob's afterlife clear every perk clientfield
//  in ONE frame (_zm_chugabud.gsc:316-321, _zm_afterlife.gsc:1329-1334), so by
//  reason 2 above that batch has no script-visible order at all. The real repair
//  is one `else NextPerkWidget = nil` in the LUI - see QUEUE.md §A1.

//  a second .help / !help, and nothing else takes it down.
//
//  🛑 THE LIST IS NOW THE REAL COMMAND SET. The user asked that it show only the

//  but the whole point of infinite ammo is so there's no reload."
//
//  The sweep refills every 0.5s, which is fine for a 30-round magazine - you
//  cannot empty one between ticks. On a 1-round weapon the magazine is empty the
//  instant you fire, and the engine starts the auto-reload on the NEXT FRAME,
//  long before the sweep comes round. The refill then lands mid-animation and you
//  watch a reload for ammo you already have.
//
//  So the refill has to happen on the SHOT, not on a timer. "weapon_fired" is the
//  notify the engine raises on the firing player, and refilling the clip in that
//  same frame means the magazine is never observed empty and the auto-reload is
//  never triggered at all - rather than being interrupted, which is not something

//  (stock only ever READS them, via player isinmovemode( "ufo", "noclip" ) in
//  _zm_devgui.gsc:1128). So flight has to be hand-rolled.
//
//  🛑 v1.18.2 hand-rolled it with setorigin() every 0.05s and the user reported it
//  "just kinda bugs out my player movement" - correctly. setorigin does not turn
//  off player physics: between our calls the engine still runs gravity, ground
//  trace and world collision on a normal walking player, then we teleport it back.
//  The two fight every frame, which is the stutter, and collision is never
//  disabled, so it is not noclip at all - you cannot pass through geometry.
//
//  The mechanism that DOES work is linking the player to a mover entity.
//  playerlinkto() hands position control to that entity outright: no gravity, no
//  world collision, view left free. Stock precedent, both shapes:
//      _qrdrone.gsc:350-352      spawn( "script_origin" ) -> hide() -> playerlinkto
//      zm_alcatraz_travel.gsc:770-774  the MOTD gondola - players ride a linked
//                                      script_origin and still look around and shoot
//  so a linked player is not a frozen one.
//
//  🛑 v1.22.0 PROBE RESULT - WASD IS NOT READABLE, AND THAT IS SETTLED.
//  v1.21.2 shipped a probe printing getnormalizedmovement() for the first ~3s of a
//  flight. Every single line in console_zm.log came back:
//      [zm_qol] fly: getnormalizedmovement UNDEFINED
//  Not "0 0" - UNDEFINED. The builtin returns nothing at all, so the movement
//  branch guarded on it could never run. That, and not the mover or the link, is
//  why flight was "stuck in place": the link held the player, and nothing ever
//  moved the mover.
//
//  Why: in the ZM script dump getnormalizedmovement() appears ONLY inside /# ... #/
//  developer blocks (_createfx.gsc:1272, 2721). It is a dev-build builtin and is
//  not exposed by the retail/Plutonium ZM build. The starter kit's GSC reference
//  lists it as a normal player function - that entry is wrong for this build, and
//  the runtime is the authority. Do not reintroduce it.
//
//  What every working T6 UFO mod does instead is read BUTTONS, never WASD, and
//  steer with the view. Two independent shipped implementations in this workspace
//  agree, and neither touches getnormalizedmovement:
//      Plutonium-T6-Scripts\chat_commands\chat_command_ufo_mode.gsc:83-117
//          MeleeButtonPressed() -> PlayerLinkTo + MoveTo( ... AnglesToForward ... )
//      littlegods-mod\funciones.gsc:1880-1921
//          fragButtonPressed() -> moveTo( origin + AnglesToForward * 20 )
//  So movement is: hold a button, fly the way you are looking. anglestoforward()
//  carries view PITCH, so looking up and holding forward climbs - jump/stance are
//  only there for fine vertical trim.
// ============================================================================
//  zmqol_fly_bind_wasd  -  REAL WASD, without reading movement state
//
//  getnormalizedmovement() is undefined in this build (see the block above
//  zmqol_fly_think), so WASD cannot be POLLED. But it can be SUBSCRIBED to:
//  notifyonplayercommand( notify, command ) fires a GSC notify when the client
//  issues a console command, and the movement keys are bound to the ordinary
//  console commands +forward / +back / +moveleft / +moveright.
//
//  🛑 The RELEASE form works too, and that is what makes held-state possible -
//  "-forward" fires on key-up. Confirmed in shipped code, not assumed:
//  Plutonium-T6-Scripts uses notifyonplayercommand("close_scores", "-scores")
//  alongside ("open_scores", "+scores"). Other shipped binds in the workspace
//  cover "+attack", "+melee", "+gostand", "+activate", "+speed_throw".
//
//  So each axis gets two one-line watcher threads - one sets the flag on press,
//  one clears it on release. Two separate watchers rather than a single
//  down-then-up loop on purpose: a loop that waits for "down" then "up" can
//  desync permanently if either notify is ever missed, and then the key sticks.
//
//  Bound once per player and guarded, because re-registering the same command
//  on every .fly toggle would stack duplicate notifies.

    //  "-moveleft". Every command in this mod is typed in chat, and flying is

//  reason to copy its shape rather than invent a second one.
//
//  🛑 COMPARED AGAINST THE ACTUAL FLY STATE, never against the dvar's previous
//  value. The other two front-ends (.fly in chat, the +actionslot 7 bind) write
//  the dvar back when they toggle, so all three stay in agreement; a
//  previous-value comparison would fight them - toggling by chat would leave
//  the dvar reading 0 while flying, and the next poll would land the player.
//  Comparing to reality makes every path idempotent.
//
//  📝 The dvar is global rather than per-player, which is right for the Mods
//  menu (host plays alone or hosts) but would toggle every player at once on a
//  server. The chat command and the key bind are both per-player and remain the
//  correct choice there.

//  .give  -  v2.8.2: EVERY weapon on THIS map, equipment included
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User, 2026-08-29: *".give for every weapon, not the current partial list.
//  Must be map-aware: only weapons that exist on the current map (no staffs on
//  Diner), and must include tactical/lethal equipment."*
//
//  🌟 THE MAP-AWARENESS IS NOT A TABLE THIS FILE MAINTAINS - IT IS THE GAME'S
//  OWN REGISTRY, READ AT RUNTIME. level.zombie_weapons is built by
//  maps\mp\zombies\_zm_weapons::add_zombie_weapon() (_zm_weapons.gsc:521-564),
//  keyed by weapon name, and that function opens with
//        if ( isdefined( level.zombie_include_weapons ) &&
//             !isdefined( level.zombie_include_weapons[weapon_name] ) ) return;
//  so the array contains EXACTLY the weapons this map included and nothing
//  else. No static per-map list can drift out of date against it, and the mod's
//  own added guns are in there too because zmqol_wallbuy_box_add() registers
//  them the same way.
//
//  🌟 EQUIPMENT IS ALREADY IN THAT SAME REGISTRY - measured, not assumed.
//  zm_transit.gsc:2011-2017 registers frag_grenade_zm, sticky_grenade_zm,
//  claymore_zm, cymbal_monkey_zm and emp_grenade_zm through add_zombie_weapon()
//  exactly like a gun, and every other map does the same with whichever subset
//  it ships. Cross-checked against the retail fastfiles themselves
//  (zm_qol - dev\parsed\sound_alias_universe\ff_weapons.txt):
//        zm_transit    frag claymore cymbal_monkey emp_grenade sticky
//        zm_nuked      frag claymore cymbal_monkey sticky
//        zm_highrise   frag claymore cymbal_monkey sticky
//        zm_prison     frag claymore willy_pete
//        zm_buried     frag claymore cymbal_monkey
//        zm_tomb       frag claymore cymbal_monkey sticky
//  So ".give monkey" works on Origins and correctly refuses on Mob, with no
//  per-map branch written here at all.
//
//  🌟 AND weapon_give() ALREADY KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH EQUIPMENT. Stock's
//  weapon_give() (_zm_weapons.gsc) branches on is_lethal_grenade /
//  is_tactical_grenade / is_placeable_mine / is_equipment and swaps out the old
//  one, calls set_player_lethal_grenade(), gives start ammo and plays the
//  pickup. Nothing about handing over a grenade needs writing here.
//
//  🛑 THE UPGRADE NAME COMES FROM THE REGISTRY, NOT FROM STRING SURGERY.
//  zmqol_give_row() derives it by splicing "_upgraded" before "_zm", which is
//  right for the mod's own rows and WRONG for anything that breaks the pattern.
//  level.zombie_weapons[name].upgrade_name is what add_zombie_weapon was handed,
//  so it is the authority - and it is undefined for equipment, which is exactly
//  how ".give monkey pap" learns to say so instead of asking for a weapon that
//  does not exist.
//
//  📝 The curated alias table is kept and is tried BEFORE the loose match, so
//  every name that worked before still works ("swat", "msmc", "ms", "mk2"...).
//  What is new is that unknown names now fall through to the registry instead
//  of being rejected.
// ============================================================================

//  Lower-case, and with every underscore removed, so "ray_gun_zm", "ray gun"
//  and "raygun" all compare equal. Written as a character loop because GSC has

//  zmqol_give_names_table  -  THE NAME A PLAYER ACTUALLY TYPES        (v2.9.0)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User, 2026-08-30: *"make sure that the commands to give the weapons are
//  simple and would be what you'd expect to input to give them via commands ...
//  most people call the mauser the mauser even though it has the c96 part."*
//
//  The four rules that existed before all worked off the DEF name, so the only
//  names that ever worked were the engine's: .give c96, .give insas,
//  .give rottweil72, .give qcw05, .give as50, .give slowgun. Nobody calls them
//  that. This table is the missing half - the in-game name -> the def.
//
//  🌟 EVERY `show` NAME BELOW IS MEASURED, NOT REMEMBERED. They were read out
//  of the game's own English string tables, dumped from the retail language
//  fastfiles (en_patch_zm, en_patch_mp, en_ui_zm, en_zm_*, en_dlc*_load_zm):
//
//      Unlinker --include-assets localize --search-path <zone/english;zone/all>
//               -o <out> <zone/english/en_*.ff>
//
//  then joined to the defs through the &"..." reference each add_zombie_weapon()
//  call passes. So `qcw05_zm` is "Chicom CQB" because WEAPON_QCW05 says so, and
//  `c96_zm` is the Mauser because ZMWEAPON_C96 says "Mauser C96" - not because
//  it sounded right. 50 of them came back from that join directly; the wonder
//  weapons came from ZMWEAPON_PARALYZER / _SLIPGUN / _JETGUN / _BLUNDERGAT /
//  ZOMBIE_FREEZEGUN / ZOMBIE_TESLA_GUN / ZMWEAPON_STAFF_*, and `slowgun_zm` is
//  confirmed the Paralyzer by its own weapon pack, "wpck_paralyzer", in
//  zm_buried.gsc:1157.
//
//  📝 THE TWO THAT ARE NOT MEASURED, stated so nobody later reads this list as
//  all-verified: `retriever` / `hellsretriever` and `redeemer` /
//  `hellsredeemer` on the two tomahawk defs. Those names are in no string table
//  this workspace can read. They are added anyway because an extra alias cannot
//  break anything - it either matches or it does not - and `tomahawk`, which IS
//  derivable from the def, is on the same rows.
//
//  🛑 ORDER MATTERS AND THIS TABLE RUNS EARLY - rule 2b, ahead of the curated
//  table (3), the loose match (4) and the art table (5). All 257 keys below
//  were diffed against those three tables. Most already existed and point at
//  the SAME def they always did (swat, fal, xpr, mp5, chicom, olympia, saiga,
//  scarh, stg44, m82, mc96, scorpion, x95l, m16a2 ...).
//
//  THREE point somewhere else than the art table did, and all three are proven
//  no-ops:
//      mp40    art -> mp40_stalker_zm     here -> mp40_zm
//      type95  art -> gl_type95_zm        here -> type95_zm
//      xm8     art -> gl_xm8_zm           here -> xm8_zm
//  RULE 2 ALREADY BEAT THE ART TABLE TO ALL THREE: it tests `<arg>_zm` first,
//  so `.give mp40` has always returned mp40_zm whenever that is registered, and
//  the art row only ever fired on a map where the plain def is absent. Rule 2b
//  carries the same isdefined() guard, so on such a map it also falls through
//  to the art rule. Same answer on every map, before and after.
//
//  `ak74u`, `b2023r` and `minigun` are deliberately ABSENT: the first two
//  already resolve elsewhere, and `minigun` is intercepted by the Death Machine
//  case before any resolver rule runs.
//
//  📝 Seven registered defs get no row on purpose - ak74u_zm,
//  knife_ballistic_no_melee_zm, the four staff_*_upgraded_zm and
//  staff_water_zm_cheap. Rules 1 and 2 already reach all of them, and the list
//  printer falls back to the trimmed def name for exactly these.
//
//  🛑 Rules 1 and 2 still run FIRST, so the raw def name always wins. Nothing
//  here can shadow `.give <def>`.
//
//  📝 A PACK-A-PUNCHED NAME IS A KEY ON THE BASE ROW - boomhilda, sweeper,
//  petrifier, sassafras, wintersfury, zeuscannon, magnacollider, vitriolic.
//  That is not an oversight, it is the convention this file already shipped:
//  `ms` / `mustang` / `sally` have been keys on m1911_zm since v1.99.25 with
//  the note *".give ms pap hands over m1911_upgraded_zm"*. So the upgraded name
//  gets you the gun, and `pap` after it gets you the upgrade - one rule for all
//  of them rather than m1911 behaving unlike the rest.

//  .give list  -  AN ON-SCREEN PANEL YOU TOGGLE, NOT A BURST OF CHAT   (v2.9.3)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User, 2026-08-30: *"the .give list chat command is awkward as it lists them
//  so fast you cant read them ... make the .give list command show all the
//  options on screen until you turn it back off with the same command"*.
//
//  Their screenshot is the proof: four lines of names on screen and the header
//  already scrolled away. iprintln() writes into the chat ring, which holds a
//  handful of lines and ages them out - so a 90-name list on Origins could
//  never be read, no matter how the printing was paced. The old version even
//  had `wait 0.05` between lines to stop it outrunning the ring; that slowed
//  the loss down without preventing it.
//
//  So this is modelled on .help, which the user named as the behaviour they
//  want: a HUD panel that stays up until the same command takes it down.
//
//  🛑 THE HUD-ELEMENT BUDGET IS SHARED WITH .help AND IT IS REAL. See
//  zmqol_help_lines() for the failure it caused there - a client has a fixed
//  allowance and this mod already spends ~13 of it on permanent elements, so
//  running two long panels at once is what silently truncated .help before.
//  Opening either panel therefore closes the other. That also keeps them from
//  being drawn on top of each other, since both anchor to the top-left.
//
//  🛑 THE TABLE IS BUILT ONCE. zmqol_give_names_table() spawns 84 structs per
//  call and zmqol_give_show_name() needs it once per registered weapon - up to
//  ~90 on a fully unlocked map. Building it inside the loop would spawn seven
//  thousand structs to draw one panel.

//  commands which get annoying". The menu is LUI and can only write DVARS, so
//  every option it offers needs one - and god / ghost / infinite ammo /
//  infinite sprint were chat-only.
//
//  🛑 FOG AND DEPTH OF FIELD ARE NOT IN HERE ON PURPOSE. `.fog` only ever sets
//  r_fog and DOF is r_dof_enable - both are CLIENT dvars, so the menu writes
//  them directly and a server-side twin would be a pointless extra hop.
//
//  Edge-triggered against the REAL per-player state, never against the dvar's
//  previous value, so the chat command and the menu can never disagree - the
//  same contract as zmqol_fly_dvar_watch() and zmqol_velocity_dvar_watch().
//  Each toggle writes its dvar back, which keeps all three front-ends in sync.

//  BOX WEIGHTING FOR THE THREE WONDER WEAPONS          (v1.75.0)
//
//  User, 2026-08-11: the Wunderwaffe never came out of the box across a whole
//  round-32 game, while the Thundergun and Winter's Howl both did.
//
//  🛑 THERE IS NO ASYMMETRY, AND THAT IS MEASURED. This is NOT a bug fix.
//  All three guns register identically - same include_weapon, same
//  add_limited_weapon( x, 1 ), same add_zombie_weapon weight of 10
//  (thundergun.gsc:36-38, teslagun.gsc:45-47, freeze.gsc:36-44). The
//  2026-08-11 23:32 boot log confirms all three reached the running game:
//  "Loaded weapon: freezegun_zm / tesla_gun_zm / thundergun_zm" and a
//  "GSC Executed ...::init()" for each, with no script error anywhere in the
//  file. And the user pulled two of the three FROM THE BOX in that same game,
//  which proves the path itself works. Neither _zm_weap_tesla.gsc nor either
//  of its two siblings touches the box.
//
//  The real number: this mod's own _zm_magicbox.gsc strips the three stock
//  filters, so treasure_chest_chooseweightedrandomweapon() is a UNIFORM draw
//  over the in-box weapons. TranZit ships 23 of those (zm_transit_dr.gsc,
//  include_weapon calls without in_box=0) plus these 3 = 26. A specific gun is
//  1/26 = 3.8% per spin, so missing it across ~40 spins is (25/26)^40 = 21%.
//  One game in five looks exactly like the user's. Variance, not a defect.
//
//  🌟 SO THIS IS A DELIBERATE WEIGHTING, and it rides TREYARCH'S OWN LIVE HOOK.
//  level.customrandomweaponweights is read by the box at _zm_magicbox.gsc:1039
//  (deliberately KEPT when this project overrode that file) and is the same
//  hook zm_buried.gsc:375 uses. Its contract is fixed by Buried's own
//  implementation (zm_buried.gsc:452): called ON THE PLAYER, takes the
//  randomized key array, returns a key array. Because the box returns the FIRST
//  key that passes its filter, extra copies of a name raise its odds - the same
//  mechanism stock's own dev-only arrayinsert( keys, forced_weapon, 0 ) relies
//  on at _zm_magicbox.gsc:1046.
//
//  📝 NOT level.weapon_weighting_funcs. That array is WRITTEN at
//  _zm_weapons.gsc:704-706 and READ NOWHERE in the 2,093-file stock dump - dead
//  WaW/BO1 legacy. Which is why stock's own default_tesla_weighting_func()
//  (:606), a pity timer written for this exact gun, has never once run in T6.
//
//  🛑 v1.98.0 - THE DIRECTION OF THIS WEIGHTING IS NOW REVERSED, and the dvar
//  above (`zmqol_box_wonder_weight`, default 2, which ADDED entries for unheld
//  wonder weapons from round 10) NO LONGER EXISTS. The user asked for the three
//  ported wonder weapons to be RARE, not boosted. The replacement dvar is
//  `zmqol_box_ww_rarity` (default 4) - see the long note above
//  zmqol_box_wonder_weapon_weights() for the measurements behind it, including
//  the finding that stock BO2 has no box weighting of any kind.
//
//  Everything above about the HOOK is still correct and still the reason this
//  works: level.customrandomweaponweights, called on the player, takes the
//  randomized key array and returns a key array. Only what we do with that
//  array changed - we now REMOVE names instead of appending them.
// ============================================================================
// ============================================================================
//  THE 9 PORTED MULTIPLAYER WEAPONS - BOX REGISTRATION       (v1.89.0)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  SWAT-556, FAL OSW, Mk 48, QBB LSW, MP7, Vector K10, MSMC, Peacekeeper and
//  the Crossbow. Their raw defs live in weapons\zm\ (Plutonium loads those
//  straight out of mod.iwd) and their 511 assets are baked into mod.ff. This
//  function is what actually puts them in the box - without it the defs and
//  assets ship and the game is functionally unchanged, which is exactly the
//  state v1.88.0 was in.
//
//  🛑 WHY A ROOT SCRIPT AND NOT SIX added_weapons(). These 9 go on EVERY map,
//  and the three wonder weapons already prove a root-script init() registers a
//  weapon successfully on every map (freeze.gsc:36-44, and the user has pulled
//  them from the box). Six per-map copies would be six places to drift.
//
//  🛑 include_weapon() MUST COME FIRST. add_zombie_weapon() opens with
//      if ( isdefined( level.zombie_include_weapons ) &&
//           !isdefined( level.zombie_include_weapons[weapon_name] ) ) return;
//  (_zm_weapons.gsc:523) - so a missing include_weapon makes the whole
//  registration a SILENT no-op. And struct.is_in_box is read straight from
//  include_weapon's flag (:558), which is why the upgraded halves pass 0: they
//  must exist as weapons but must never be a box result on their own.
//
//  🌟 EVERY VALUE HERE IS TREYARCH'S OR REIMAGINED'S, NOT INVENTED:
//    - the display refs are each def's own displayName field, and all nine were
//      confirmed to already resolve on a zombies map by dumping the localize
//      asset of every en_*.ff a zombies map loads. Only WEAPON_PEACEKEEPER had
//      to be shipped (DLC weapon, its string is in the MP patch zone only).
//    - the costs are BO2-Reimagined's for these same nine weapons.
//    - the vox packs are stock's OWN class mapping from _zm_audio.gsc:123-140:
//      "smg" -> wpck_smg, "assault"/"mg" -> wpck_mg, and - note - stock maps
//      "crossbow" -> wpck_launcher, so the crossbow uses that and not wpck_explo.
//    - the 8th argument is create_vox, NOT an in-box flag. Verified against the
//      real signature, add_zombie_weapon( weapon_name, upgrade_name, hint, cost,
//      weaponvo, weaponvoresp, ammo_cost, create_vox ) at _zm_weapons.gsc:521.
//      Stock passes 1 alongside a wpck_* pack; that is what is copied here.
//
//  📝 THE ATTACHMENT AND PROJECTILE VARIANTS are included with in_box = 0. They
//  are reachable only through Pack-a-Punch attachments or as a projectile, never
//  as a box result, but they must be included or the weapon they belong to
//  cannot resolve them.
//
//  🛑 THE CLIENT TWIN IS zm_expanded.csc::zmqol_mp_weapons_init() AND IT MUST
//  LIST THE SAME WEAPONS. clientscripts _zm_weapons::include_weapon builds
//  level._included_weapons / _display_box_weapons, which drives what the client
//  will draw over the box.
//
//  Bounded and reversible, per the "every feature is also a dvar" rule:
//      zmqol_mp_weapons 0   registers none of them (stock box)

//  THE EMP GRENADE, IN THE BOX ON EVERY MAP                          (v2.9.13)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User request 2026-08-31: *"Add the EMP Grenade to the Mystery Box item pool
//  across ALL Black Ops 2 Zombies maps (not just Tranzit/Green Run maps)."*
//
//  Registration is stock's own, copied line for line from zm_transit.gsc:1926
//  and :2017 - the weight function, the cost, the vox pack and the trailing 1
//  are all Treyarch's numbers, not chosen here:

//                         undefined, 1 );
//
//  🛑 TRANZIT IS SKIPPED. It already registers all of this in its own stock
//  script; doing it twice would put a second copy in the box pool.
//
//  🛑 THE ASSETS. emp_grenade_zm lives in zm_transit.ff and NOWHERE else -
//  measured with Unlinker over all six maps and common_zm - so mod.ff now owns
//  the weapon plus its 2 xmodels and its fx (zone_source\mod_emp.zone). The
//  module's other effect is in common_zm, which loads on every map anyway.
//
//  🛑 THE CLIENT MUST MATCH. zm_expanded.csc includes the same weapon; the box
//  needs it on both sides to draw the pickup model. Registering on one side
//  only is the EXE_CLIENT_FIELD_MISMATCH class.
//
//  🌟 WHAT THIS COSTS IN CLIENTFIELD BITS - AND WHY THE OLD COMMENT WAS WRONG.
//  perks_register_clientfield() in this file narrows every perk field to 1 bit
//  unless emp_grenade_zm is included, and its comment claimed that was "stock's
//  own rule". IT IS NOT. Stock's _zm_perks.gsc hardcodes **2** for all eight
//  perk fields and never mentions the EMP at all, and the game's own runtime
//  clientfield dumps confirm 2 bits on EVERY map - Origins, Buried, Mob, Die
//  Rise and Nuketown included, none of which ship the grenade.
//  So this feature does not "cost" bits that stock was saving; it restores the
//  width stock always used. It also repairs a real latent defect: perk_pause()
//  writes the value 2 (_zm_perks.gsc:2650) and a 1-bit field cannot hold it, so
//  on those five maps the "perk disabled" state was being truncated whenever a
//  machine lost power.
//  🛑 RESIDUAL RISK, STATED PLAINLY: it is still +1 bit x 9 perk fields on five
//  maps, and toplayer's real ceiling is unmeasured (ERROR_CATALOGUE section 2
//  says never issue a verdict from that arithmetic). If any map now fails to
//  load with "Client Field Set toplayer is out of space", set `emp_all_maps 0`
//  at the console and it reverts with no rebuild.

//                                                       (v1.99.56 / v1.99.58)
//
//  User, 2026-08-18: first "the Colt M16A1... you couldn't spin it in the
//  mystery box", then "add the m14 and olympia and the m1911 to the box, the two
//  classic wall weapon buys in first rooms for bo1 and bo2... more the merrier".
//
//  THE WHOLE THING IS ONE ARGUMENT OF TREYARCH'S. Every map registers these
//  guns like this (zm_transit.gsc:1901, :1869, zm_buried.gsc:1195, :1201,
//  zm_highrise.gsc:893, :899 ...):
//
//      include_weapon( "m16_zm", 0 );
//
//  That trailing 0 is the in_box flag, and _zm_weapons.gsc copies it onto the
//  weapon struct as struct.is_in_box when add_zombie_weapon builds it. It is
//  read ONCE, at registration. Nothing else about these guns differs from a box
//  weapon - they already have upgrades, camos, Pack-a-Punch names and full
//  animation sets.
//
//  So on a map that already registered the gun, the whole fix is that one struct
//  field. On a map that never registered it, it is registered here with STOCK'S
//  OWN values - hint, cost and vox copied from the map scripts, never invented:
//
//    m16_zm         &"ZOMBIE_WEAPON_M16"        1200  "burstrifle"  zm_transit:2001
//    rottweil72_zm  &"ZOMBIE_WEAPON_ROTTWEIL72"  500  "shotgun"     zm_buried:1131
//    m1911_zm       &"ZOMBIE_WEAPON_M1911"        50  ""            zm_transit:1985
//
//  THE OLYMPIA IS NOT CALLED "OLYMPIA" - the weapon is rottweil72_zm and its ART
//  is called olympia (t6_wpn_shotty_olympia_view, viewmodel_olympia_*). Its
//  wall-buy effect is literally fx_zmb_wall_buy_olympia (_zm.gsc:1221). That is
//  the def-name-vs-art-name trap: searching the weapon list for "olympia" finds
//  nothing, and searching the art for "rottweil" finds nothing. Both halves are
//  already in mod.ff - 24 xanims, 2 xmodels, 3 materials, 5 images.
//
//  COMPLETENESS AUDIT, run before a line was written, because the user asked
//  specifically after the Titus and SWAT both shipped missing sounds:
//
//    models/anims  all three are declared in mod_base.zone as `weapon` assets
//                  with their art - which is why they already work as wall buys
//                  on every map this mod loads. m1911 carries 88 asset lines,
//                  the Olympia 34, the M16 79.
//    sound         each def's aliases enumerated BY VALUE, not guessed: 17 for
//                  the Olympia, 17 for the M1911, 17 for the M16. In every case
//                  16 are already in mod.all and the 17th is wpn_melee_hit, the
//                  universal melee alias shared by 18 of the 86 shipped defs.
//                  The M16 shipped on exactly this basis in v1.99.56 and the
//                  user confirmed it in game, which is the proof the reading is
//                  right rather than merely plausible.
//    Pack-a-Punch  every upgraded def here has an EMPTY attachments field, so
//                  none needs a row in zm/pap_attach_qol.csv. Same reason
//                  mk48/insas/crossbow need none, and why these cannot hit the
//                  v1.89.3 Pack-a-Punch freeze.
//    strings       ZOMBIE_WEAPON_M16 / _ROTTWEIL72 / _M1911 and their _UPGRADED
//                  twins all live in en_patch_zm.ff, which EVERY zombies map
//                  loads - confirmed with Unlinker --list, not assumed.
//    no regression the wall buys are untouched: on a map that already registered
//                  the gun only is_in_box changes, so cost, hint and vox stay
//                  exactly as the map set them.
//
//  🛑🛑 v1.99.91 - THE M14 PARAGRAPH BELOW IS WRONG AND THE M14 IS NOW SHIPPED.
//  It is kept because the reasoning error is worth seeing. It concluded "this
//  mod ships no m14 def and no m14 art, so this is an asset job" - true about
//  mod.ff, and irrelevant, because the M14 never needed to come from mod.ff.
//  EVERY zombies map registers it itself, measured in the stock dump:
//      zm_transit.gsc:1999  zm_transit_dr.gsc:706  zm_nuked.gsc:876
//      zm_highrise.gsc:834  zm_buried.gsc:1134     zm_prison.gsc:778
//      zm_tomb.gsc:1006     - each followed by include_weapon( "m14_zm", 0 )
//  add_zombie_weapon has already built the struct and the map's own fastfile has
//  already loaded the def, the models and the anims - which is exactly the case
//  zmqol_wallbuy_box_add() handles by flipping is_in_box and returning. The gun
//  is a working wall buy on every map today; the ONLY thing that kept it out of
//  the box was that trailing 0. The add_zombie_weapon fallback in that function
//  is therefore unreachable for the M14 on every shipping map, and its stock
//  values (m14_upgraded_zm, &"ZOMBIE_WEAPON_M14", 500, "rifle") are passed
//  anyway so the call is correct if a future map ever omits it.
//
//  The paragraph as written in v1.99.58:
//  THE M14 IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE, AND THE USER DID ASK FOR IT. m14_zm is a
//  real BO2 weapon (_zm.gsc:1218 registers its wall-buy fx; Buried and Die Rise
//  register the gun), but this mod ships NO m14 weapon def and NO m14 art -
//  there is no `weapon,m14_zm` row in mod_base.zone and no m14 xmodel or xanim
//  anywhere in it. Adding it is an ASSET job - dumping the def and its animation
//  set out of a stock fastfile and shipping them in mod.ff - not a registration
//  one, and it carries the asset-ownership risk that has broken maps before. It
//  is queued as its own item rather than half-done here.
//
//  Bounded and reversible:
//      zmqol_wallbuy_box 0   leave every gun exactly as the map shipped it
//      zmqol_wallbuy_box 1   DEFAULT
//  v1.99.56 called this dvar zmqol_m16_box. Renamed with the feature one version
//  later: it is console-only, never appeared in a menu, and so was never archived
//  into anyone's config - the rule about never renaming a menu row's dvar does
//  not apply here.
//  THE CLIENT TWIN is zm_expanded.csc::zmqol_wallbuy_box_init() and it must list

//  zmqol_tomb_weapon  -  ORIGINS GETS PRIVATE COPIES OF NINE GUNS    (v2.9.1)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User, 2026-08-30: *"the mp5 no longer uses the custom sounds from the zone
//  folder ... make sure that all the custom sounds from the sound pack work,
//  all of them with no exceptions, without causing any other sounds from the
//  base game to go silent"* - then, asked how Origins should be handled:
//  *"make the sounds work for all maps origins included, don't remove them
//  from the box."*
//
//  THE BIND, measured. Nine guns - MP5, Olympia, M16, XPR-50, Barrett, Judge,
//  S12, Saritch, MTAR - have their aliases declared by SEVEN of the eight map
//  banks. Origins' bank declares ZERO of them, because retail never puts those
//  guns on Origins. So:
//      declare them in mod.all  -> audible on Origins, but mod.all loads first
//                                  and shadows the user's pack on the other 7
//      do not declare them      -> the pack wins on 7, silent on Origins
//  v2.8.8 took the first branch and that is exactly the regression reported.
//
//  🌟 THE WAY OUT IS TO STOP SHARING THE NAME. Origins now gets its own copies
//  of the nine defs - mp5kqol_zm, rottweil72qol_zm, ... - identical to the
//  originals except that their two fire-sound fields point at wpn_<gun>qol_*.
//  mod.all declares only those private names, which no stock bank uses, so it
//  shadows nothing anywhere. On the other seven maps the stock def and the
//  stock alias are untouched and the pack serves them again.
//
//  🛑 THE ONE THING THIS CANNOT FIX, stated rather than hidden: the reload and
//  cocking foley (fly_<gun>_*) is named by the XANIM notetracks, not by the
//  weapon file - the defs' notetrackSoundMap is empty, verified on mp5k_zm. A
//  private weapon cannot redirect a shared animation, so those 50 foley rows
//  stay under their stock names and stay mod-supplied on every map. Only the
//  111 fire-chain names moved.
//
//  🛑 SERVER ONLY. level.script is used 30 times in this file and never once in
//  any stock .csc - the client half is done in zm_tomb.csc, which only ever
//  loads on Origins and so needs no map test at all.

//  🛑 v1.98.0 - THIS FUNCTION IS INVERTED. IT USED TO MAKE THE THREE WONDER
//  WEAPONS **MORE** COMMON; IT NOW MAKES THEM RARER.
//
//  User, 2026-08-16: *"make the 3 wonder weapon ports have the same chance to
//  obtain from the mystery box as the raygun mark 2, which is a lot lower than
//  other weapons, and any other weapons like standard assault rifles etc. have
//  standard chances to get like any existing box weapon."*
//
//  🌟 FIRST, THE MEASURED FACT, BECAUSE IT CHANGES THE ANSWER: **BO2 DOES NOT
//  GIVE THE RAY GUN MARK 2 A LOWER BOX CHANCE.** There is no weighting in the
//  game at all. Checked, not assumed:
//    - `treasure_chest_chooseweightedrandomweapon` (_zm_magicbox.gsc:911) is a
//      flat `array_randomize` over every in-box weapon, then the first one that
//      passes the filter. Stock's copy and this mod's copy are identical here.
//    - `level.customrandomweaponweights` is the only weighting hook, and the
//      ONE stock map that sets it (zm_buried.gsc:375) points it at
//      `buried_custom_weapon_weights( keys ) { return keys; }` - a no-op stub.
//    - `add_limited_weapon( "raygun_mark2_zm", 4 )` is a per-PLAYER quota of 4,
//      which never binds in a 4-player game and never in solo. The guns that
//      really are capped are the map wonder weapons - Paralyzer and Sliquifier
//      are `add_limited_weapon( x, 1 )`.
//    - `special_weapon_magicbox_check` only stops Ray Gun and Mark 2 dropping
//      for the same player; it is mutual exclusion, not rarity.
//  So "the same chance as the Mark 2" and "a lot lower than other weapons" are
//  two different requests. This implements the SECOND one, because that is what
//  was described - and `zmqol_box_ww_rarity 1` gives the first one exactly.
//
//  📝 WHAT WAS ACTIVELY WRONG BEFORE. The old default was
//  `zmqol_box_wonder_weight 2`, which appended two extra entries per unheld
//  wonder weapon from round 10 - the exact opposite of what the user wants, and
//  on by default. That behaviour is gone, not merely re-tuned.
//
//  HOW THE THINNING WORKS. The box returns the FIRST key that passes its filter
//  from a shuffled list, so a name's chance is its share of the list. Deleting a
//  name from the shuffled copy on most spins scales its chance down by exactly
//  that fraction, and touches nothing else:
//
//      zmqol_box_ww_rarity 1   same chance as any other gun (= the real Mark 2)
//      zmqol_box_ww_rarity 4   DEFAULT - a quarter as likely as an ordinary gun
//      zmqol_box_ww_rarity 0   never from the box (.thundergun etc. still work)
//
//  🌟 THE ORDINARY GUNS ARE NOT TOUCHED AT ALL. Only the three names below are
//  ever removed, so every other weapon - stock or ported - keeps precisely the
//  share it has today. That is the "standard chances" half of the request, and
//  it is satisfied by doing nothing rather than by a second adjustment.
//
//  📝 THE REAL REASON A SPECIFIC GUN IS HARD TO GET, and it is not a defect:
//  the box now holds roughly 75 in-box names per map (stock's ~40, plus the
//  cross-map additions, plus 11 ported MP guns, plus these 3). A named gun is
//  ~1.3% per spin, so missing one across a 40-spin game is ~59% likely. Nothing
//  is replaced - that was audited name by name for v1.98.0 and only ONE name on
//  ONE map is re-registered at all (qcw05_zm on Buried, which the mod re-adds
//  WITH an upgrade because stock leaves its upgrade undefined).

//  these weapons, allowing multiple players to pull the same Wonder Weapon
//  simultaneously and allowing players to pull it from the box again to refill
//  ammo."*
//
//  🌟 WHAT THE CAP ACTUALLY IS, traced rather than assumed. Each ported gun
//  registers `add_limited_weapon( <gun>, 1 )` in its own init (thundergun.gsc:37,
//  teslagun.gsc:46, freeze.gsc:37), which writes level.limited_weapons[<gun>] = 1.
//  Exactly two things in the stock tree read that table:
//     _zm_weapons::limited_weapon_below_quota()   the quota itself - the magic
//         box (_zm_magicbox.gsc:893) and the four buildable-bench call sites in
//         _zm_buildables.gsc (:1723, :2033, :2060, :2093).
//     _zm_utility::is_limited_weapon()            the weapon locker / fridge on
//         TranZit, Die Rise and Buried, which refuses to store a limited weapon.
//         📝 That one does NOT consult the switch below - it reads the table
//         directly - so the fridge still refuses these guns. Out of scope here;
//         written down so nobody re-derives it.
//
//  🌟 AND STOCK SHIPS THE SWITCH ITSELF. limited_weapon_below_quota() opens
//  with `if ( is_true( level.no_limited_weapons ) ) return false;`
//  (_zm_weapons.gsc:737) - a global kill switch for every quota check that no
//  stock map ever sets. Mirroring the row into it is therefore not an invention
//  and cannot desync from the box: it is the game's own supported way to say
//  "no quotas", and it covers every caller at once.
//
//  📝 THE BOX PATH WAS ALREADY CORRECT, and this is deliberately additive.
//  This mod's _zm_magicbox.gsc override already skips has_weapon_or_upgrade,
//  limited_weapon_below_quota and special_weapon_magicbox_check whenever the row
//  is on, so a second player could already pull the same wonder weapon and a
//  re-pull already refilled it (stock weapon_give() gives start ammo to a weapon
//  you already hold, _zm_weapons.gsc:744). What this adds is that the SAME row
//  now also governs every other quota reader, so the answer cannot differ
//  depending on which door the weapon came through.
//
//  🛑 WHAT THIS DOES CHANGE BEYOND THE BOX, said plainly: with the row on,
//  the buildable benches (Sliquifier, Paralyzer, Jet Gun) also stop enforcing
//  their one-per-match quota. That is the same sentence as the row's name read

//  round" - .where x -6269 y -7206 z -63 yaw 236, the ground behind the car.
//
//  🛑 I COULD NOT NAME THE SPAWNER OFFLINE, so this ships a MEASUREMENT rather
//  than a guessed fix (CLAUDE.md: "ship a probe that distinguishes the outcomes
//  rather than a fix built on the likeliest one"). What was ruled out, each from
//  a file actually read:
//
//    1. It is not one of the 8 spawners already disabled. All 8 origins were
//       matched against the zm_transit mapents dump and every one is real, and
//       "[zm_qol] diner main: DONE" is present in the boot log AFTER
//       disable_zombie_spawn_locations() runs - so the pass completed without
//       erroring and the disables applied.
//    2. Nothing re-enables them. _zm_zonemgr::reinit_zone_spawners() DOES force
//       is_enabled = 1 on every unblocked spot (:357-360), but it is called
//       NOWHERE in the 2,093-file stock dump - dead code. zone_init() returns
//       early on an already-initialised zone (:168), so it cannot re-run either.
//    3. No enabled regular spawner is anywhere near the reported spot. Every
//       *_spawners struct in the Diner-area zones was dumped and classified; the
//       nearest ENABLED one is (-5718,-7272,-64), 555 units away. The nearest
//       spawner of any kind is (-6462,-7159,-64) at 198 units - already off.
//    4. It is not the undefined-entrance-node path at _zm_spawner.gsc:411-425.
//       That branch would assign an undefined node (zm_transit has 38
//       exterior_goal structs and ZERO with script_string "find_flesh"), but
//       should_skip_teardown() returns true for exactly that string at :330, so
//       the :383 branch is taken and RETURNS at :409 first. It never runs.
//
//  So the zombie is very likely standing where it was BLOCKED rather than where
//  it spawned, and only its own spawn_point can identify the source.
//
//  🌟 self.spawn_point is assigned in exactly ONE place in stock -
//  _zm_spawner.gsc:2674, "self.spawn_point = spot" - so every zombie carries the
//  struct that produced it. Printing that names the offending spawner outright,
//  and the fix is then the same one-line origin match the other 8 use.
//
//      zmqol_stranded_probe 1   DEFAULT - report, costs one 5s loop

//  not exist in retail. Worse, its mechanism would not work even if copied

//  matching `level endon( "kill_round" )` - _zm.gsc:2902, :3153,
//  _zm_ai_dogs.gsc:95 - is ALSO inside a /# #/ block. In a retail game that

//
//  🌟 THE RETAIL PATH, read out of round_think()/round_wait() instead:
//  round_wait() (_zm.gsc:3700) returns as soon as
//      get_current_zombie_count() == 0 && level.zombie_total == 0 && !intermission
//  and round_think() then fires "end_of_round" and does level.round_number++
//  (:3483-3514) before looping into round_start(), which re-derives everything
//  for the new round. round_spawning() calls ai_calculate_health() itself at
//  :2921, so health does NOT need setting by hand.

//
//  🛑 1. MAGIC-BULLET-SHIELD ZOMBIES ARE SKIPPED. That shield is what stock puts
//  on scripted and boss zombies - the Origins panzer, Mob's brutus, the Die Rise
//  elevator scripts - and damaging one anyway does not just kill something it
//  should not, it breaks the map script that was waiting on it. The mod already
//  respects this in two other places (the nuke at :848 and :865, the tesla gun at
//  _zm_weap_tesla.gsc:304); this brings the round jump into line with them.
//
//  🛑 2. HEALTH IS RESET BEFORE THE DAMAGE, BECAUSE OF DIE RISE. Its zombies can
//  carry NEGATIVE health, and `dodamage( self.health + 666 )` on a zombie at
//  -5000 health asks for -4334 damage, which is not lethal - the horde simply
//  survives the jump. Setting a known positive health first makes the +666

//
//  User: "the .fly command sometimes is weird sometimes when i do it, it keeps
//  moving by itself but sometimes it works fine".
//
//  The held-key state is built from EDGES, not from polling - +forward sets the
//  flag, -forward clears it, because getnormalizedmovement() does not exist in
//  this build and WASD cannot be read any other way. Edge tracking has one
//  failure mode and this is it: MISS A RELEASE AND THE KEY IS HELD FOREVER.
//
//  And there is a release that is very easy to miss, built into how the command
//  is issued. You type .fly IN CHAT. Opening chat takes keyboard focus away from
//  movement, so a W that was down when the chat box opened can have its key-up
//  swallowed - the client sends +forward and never sends -forward. The flag is
//  now stuck at 1, and it stays stuck for the rest of the match because these
//  watcher threads run whether or not anyone is flying.
//
//  That is exactly the reported shape: intermittent, tied to the moment of
//  toggling, and "sometimes it works fine" - it works whenever you happened to be
//  standing still as you opened chat.
//
//  So the flags are wiped at every takeoff and every landing. A stuck key can no
//  longer outlive one flight, and cannot leak into the next one. If a key really
//  is still physically down after a wipe, the next press re-sets it; the cost of
//  being wrong here is one keystroke, against a permanent drift.
//
//  📝 The general shape, worth keeping: EDGE-DERIVED STATE NEEDS A RESYNC POINT.
//  If you cannot poll the truth, at least re-zero at a moment when you know what
//  the state should be. Takeoff is that moment.

//  The SERVER half lives in maps\mp\zombies\_zm_perk_divetonuke::init_divetonuke,
//  and the ONLY caller of that is divetonuke_perk_machine_think() - i.e. it runs
//  only once a PhD machine is actually being processed, which is both far too

//  intended for multiplayer games, and it makes no sense to have that perk

//  🌟 TREYARCH AGREED, AND SHIPPED THE CODE. This is not a house rule invented
//  here - stock has a function for it, by this name:
//
//      maps\mp\zm_transit_utility.gsc:205
//      solo_tombstone_removal()
//      {
//          if ( getnumexpectedplayers() > 1 )

//          level thread maps\mp\zombies\_zm_perks::perk_machine_removal( "specialty_scavenger" );
//      }
//
//  It is threaded from zm_transit_classic.gsc:103 and zm_transit_standard_town
//  .gsc:36 - and NOWHERE ELSE. So stock removes it in solo on TranZit Classic
//  and Town survival only; Die Rise and Buried keep offering a perk that cannot
//  do anything for a solo player. This mod also hands it out through the
//  Wunderfizz on every map, which stock never did. Hence: same rule, applied
//  everywhere, using stock's own removal call rather than a lookalike.
//
//  🛑 THE TEST IS getnumexpectedplayers(), COPIED FROM STOCK'S OWN LINE.
//  Not flag( "solo_game" ) - that is not set until players have connected, and
//  this has to answer during init. This build's own boot log confirms the
//  builtin reports correctly here: `[zm_qol] solo status: expected=1`.
//
//  🛑 AND IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH level.zombiemode_using_tombstone_perk.
//  That flag gates registerclientfield( "toplayer", "perk_tombstone" ) on BOTH

    //  not in the map list above.
    //
    //  🛑 zm_tomb IS DELIBERATELY NOT ADDED TO THAT LIST. The block also calls
    //  _zm_perk_divetonuke::enable_divetonuke_perk_for_level(), and Origins
    //  ALREADY has dive-to-nuke natively - perk_dive_to_nuke is in its stock
    //  clientfield dump. Re-enabling an already-enabled perk risks the
    //  "Attempt to register ClientField ... already registered" fatal that the
    //  Electric Cherry block above this function documents. Marathon, Deadshot
    //  and Additional Primary are likewise already native on Origins (all three
    //  are in its stock dump), so the ONLY thing Origins is actually missing is
    //  Tombstone. Setting one flag is the whole fix.
    //
    //  🌟 THE CLIENTFIELD BUDGET WAS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED, because overflowing
    //  the toplayer set does not cost a perk - it stops the map loading.
    //  From the per-map dumps in Black Ops 2 Grand Resources\...\Clientfields\:

    //        zm_tomb        45         16         61
    //
    //  Origins carries 3 bits MORE headroom than Buried, where Tombstone
    //  already ships and works. The delta from this change is exactly one
    //  field, perk_tombstone, at `bits` wide (2 on Origins, which has
    //  emp_grenade_zm). The mod REPLACES _zm_perks::perks_register_clientfield
    //  on both sides rather than adding to it, so these do not stack on top of
    //  stock's - the mod's list IS the perk list.
    //

    //
    //  The arithmetic is unchanged from the block above, just spent differently:

    //  WHAT ORIGINS LOSES, precisely: Tombstone stops being offered by the
    //  Wunderfizz (wunderfizz.gsc:1712 reads this same flag) and drops out of
    //  getPerks(). Origins has no Tombstone MACHINE - it never did - so nothing
    //  visible is removed from the map, and every other use of the flag is an

    //  v1.62.8/v1.62.9 owned Electric Cherry's reload attack by re-pointing
    //  level._custom_perks[...].player_thread_give at our own copy of
    //  electric_cherry_reload_attack(), to instrument it and then to delete
    //  stock's consecutive-reload throttle and its 0.1s per-zombie damage
    //  stagger. Both deletions were real defects in stock's own terms and both
    //  are now REVERTED, because they made the perk behave and LOOK different
    //  from the one Mob of the Dead and Origins ship:
    //
    //    - no stagger  -> every zombie's tesla_shock fx started in the same
    //                     frame instead of 0.1s apart, so the zap read as one
    //                     bright mass rather than an arc travelling the crowd.
    //    - no throttle -> reload #3+ played full-strength fx where stock plays
    //                     a reduced set or none.
    //
    //  The user's instruction is that the job here is PORTING, not tuning:
    //  *"don't change how electric cherry behaves because you're not meant to
    //  change the perk just leave it alone and then port it over to the maps
    //  that don't have it already. simple, same logic for literally any other
    //  perk (eg. who's who)."*

    //  So the perk now runs stock's own electric_cherry_reload_attack() on
    //  every map, byte-for-byte the function Mob and Origins run. Everything
    //  this mod still does for Electric Cherry is ADDITIVE and only fills a gap
    //  the port leaves - the perk machine/Wunderfizz entry above, and
    //  qol_options.gsc's zmqol_cherry_zap, which supplies the zmb_cherry_explode
    //  audio on maps whose soundbanks lack Alcatraz's alias and is explicitly

//  are the whole gap.
//
//  🛑 WHY THIS NEEDED AN ASSET AND NOT JUST THE ONE-LINE INCLUDE.
//  _zm_powerups::add_zombie_powerup() precaches the model only for powerups

//  and Unlinker --list shows zombie_firesale is absent from zm_transit.ff and
//  zm_highrise.ff - the same two maps. So including it without shipping the
//  model would precache something the level does not have, which is fatal at
//  load. zone_source\mod_locations.zone now carries it; see the block there.
//
//  🛑 TIMING. include_powerup() only sets level.zombie_include_powerups[name],
//  which _zm_powerups::init() reads later when it calls add_zombie_powerup for
//  each one - so this MUST run before that init. main() is inside Plutonium's

//  User, 2026-08-11: *"add these 2 power ups to all the maps that you can that
//  aren't limited by the game... and also for origins make it so that blood
//  money can spawn naturally and it doesn't need to be dug up in a dig site."*
//
//  🌟 BLOOD MONEY IS NOT AN ORIGINS POWERUP. It is `bonus_points_player`, and it
//  is registered in CORE, on every map in the game:
//      _zm_powerups.gsc:106
//      add_zombie_powerup( "bonus_points_player", "zombie_z_money_icon",
//                          &"ZOMBIE_POWERUP_BONUS_POINTS",
//                          ::func_should_never_drop, 1, 0, 0 );
//  Only Origins ever switched it on (zm_tomb.gsc:1176 server, zm_tomb.csc:416
//  client), and even there stock hands it out solely from a dig site
//  (zm_tomb_dig.gsc:442, the "bonus_points_player" branch of dig_up_powerup).
//
//  🌟 IT COSTS ZERO CLIENTFIELD BITS, and that is the reason it can ship on
//  EVERY map while Zombie Blood cannot. The 7-argument call above stops short of
//  add_zombie_powerup's `client_field_name` parameter, so the
//  registerclientfield() at _zm_powerups.gsc:449 never runs - server or client
//  (the client's own add_zombie_powerup, _zm_powerups.csc:20, likewise passes no
//  field name). Nothing is added to the `toplayer` set, so the per-map budget
//  wall documented in .agents\QUEUE.md does not apply here at all.
//
//  📝 EVERYTHING IT DOES IS ALREADY CORE, so this port adds no behaviour of its
//  own - which is exactly what [[zm-qol-port-never-tune]] asks for:
//    - the grab is handled by core powerup_grab()'s own
//      `case "bonus_points_player"` (_zm_powerups.gsc:1060), which threads
//      bonus_points_player_powerup() - randomintrange( 1, 25 ) * 100 points to
//      the grabbing player only, skipped in last stand or spectator.
//    - the pickup glow is level._effect["powerup_on_solo"], loaded by core's
//      client init on every map (solo = 1 in the call above).
//    - the hint string &"ZOMBIE_POWERUP_BONUS_POINTS" is core-localized.
//
//  🛑 THE ANNOUNCER VO IS DELIBERATELY LEFT SILENT, and that is parity, not a
//  gap. powerup_grab() calls powerup_vo( "bonus_points_solo" ), which reaches
//  _zm_audio::create_and_play_dialog() - and that function's second statement is
//      if ( !isdefined( level.vox.speaker[self.zmbvoxid].alias[category][type] ) )
//          return;
//  `createvox( "bonus_points_solo", ... )` appears NOWHERE in the 2,093-file
//  stock dump - not in core's _zm_audio_announcer.gsc (which does register
//  carpenter, insta_kill, double_points, nuke, full_ammo, fire_sale, minigun and
//  zombie_blood), and not on Origins either. So Blood Money is silent on the map
//  that ships it, and adding a line here would make this port LOUDER than the
//  original - the v1.62.9 mistake.
//
//  🛑 TIMING. include_powerup() only writes level.zombie_include_powerups[name];
//  _zm_powerups::init() reads it later, when it calls add_zombie_powerup for each
//  entry. main() is inside Plutonium's precache window and runs ahead of every
//  ::init(), and of the map's own main() - so writing here is early enough. It is
//  purely additive (include_zombie_powerup creates the array only if undefined
//  and never clears it), so the map's own include_powerups() cannot clobber it,
//  and our entry cannot be lost.
//
//  📝 NO MAP GATE, unlike zmqol_enable_fire_sale above, and that is safe for two
//  independent reasons. First, include_zombie_powerup() is idempotent - it sets
//  the key to 1 - so calling it on Origins, which already includes it, is a
//  no-op. Second, the "creating the array flips the filter" trap called out in
//  zm_expanded.csc's fire-sale block cannot bite: all six maps populate
//  level.zombie_include_powerups themselves on BOTH sides (verified - zm_transit,

//  User, 2026-08-19: ON = the mod's added drops (Zombie Blood, Blood Money,
//  Death Machine); OFF = the stock power-up table only.
//
//  🛑 WHAT THIS GATES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
//  It gates ONLY the calls that put a power-up into the drop table -
//  include_powerup / include_zombie_powerup / add_zombie_powerup /
//  powerup_set_can_pick_up_in_last_stand - and the Blood Money drop-function
//  re-point. It does NOT gate a single registerclientfield, visionset,
//  loadfx or precache.
//
//  🌟 THAT IS THE WHOLE SAFETY ARGUMENT, and it is the trap QUEUE.md flagged as
//  the highest-risk part of this item. A clientfield registered on the server
//  and not on the client - or registered on one map's boot and not the next -
//  is EXE_CLIENT_FIELD_MISMATCH at load, which is fatal and gives no useful
//  error (ERROR_CATALOGUE §1). Leaving every registration exactly where it is
//  means the per-map bit budget with this row OFF is byte-identical to the
//  budget with it ON, on every map, so the row cannot break a boot. The cost is
//  a few reserved bits nobody reads while it is off, which is invisible.
//
//  🌟 ORIGINS IS ALREADY CORRECT WITHOUT A SPECIAL CASE, and that is measured:
//    - Zombie Blood: zmqol_zombie_blood_enabled() already returns 0 on zm_tomb
//      because Origins registers the power-up itself, so this row never reaches
//      it there.
//    - Blood Money: Origins includes it in its OWN main() -
//      <gsc-dump>\ZM\Maps\Origins\maps\mp\zm_tomb.gsc:1176
//      include_powerup( "bonus_points_player" ) - so skipping this mod's
//      include on Origins changes nothing, and skipping the drop-function
//      re-point returns it to stock's ::func_should_never_drop, i.e. dig-site
//      only. That IS Origins' vanilla behaviour, which is exactly what OFF is
//      supposed to mean per the user's requirement.
//

//  BY THIS MOD RATHER THAN THROUGH STOCK'S QUEUE                     (v2.8.8)
//
//  User, 2026-08-30: the Blood Money line was silent on Nuketown while Zombie
//  Blood's played, and both go through the same stock path.
//
//  🌟 WHAT WAS RULED OUT FIRST, by measurement, not by reading:
//    - the alias exists under BOTH announcer prefixes -
//      vox_zmba_qol_powerup_blood_money and vox_zmba_sam_qol_powerup_blood_money,
//      each in the bare and the _0 form;
//    - the payload is really in the shipped bank - id 0x87bbb7b9, 64106 bytes,
//      inside mod.all.sabs (dumped from the built file, not assumed);
//    - the registration runs, and it runs to completion - Zombie Blood's line
//      is audible on Nuketown, and its createvox is the statement immediately
//      before Blood Money's, so both executed.
//
//  So the alias half is provably fine and the fault is in the trigger, which is
//  stock's own path: _zm_powerups.gsc:1147 threads leaderdialog( powerup_name ),
//  and leaderdialogonplayer() drops the line outright when self.zmbdialogactive
//  is already 1 (no queue flag is passed). Nothing offline pins down which
//  earlier line sets it, so this stops depending on that path at all.
//
//  🛑 THIS IS A replaceFunc OF A 9-LINE STOCK FUNCTION, and the stock body is
//  copied verbatim above the new call - the points award must stay identical.
//  See _zm_powerups.gsc:2062.

//  fault: Death Machine and Bonfire Sale shipped on bus_hdrfx / grp_hdrfx /
//  snp_hdrfx at volume 73 with pitch +200, because their rows were copied
//  verbatim from the zmb_vox_ann_* rows their payloads came out of - and those
//  are DEV LEFTOVERS (FileSource devraw\..., played by none of the 2,093 stock
//  scripts), so Treyarch's mix on them was never exercised. snp_hdrfx is ducked
//  by other audio, which is exactly what a power-up grab always has. Measured

//  use bus_voice / grp_voice / snp_never_duck / vol 84 / pitch 0 / priority 100

//
//  User, 2026-08-21: *"if you have the custom power ups option enabled,
//  alongside all the power ups it already allows for, add fire sale in to the
//  equation as well so that all maps can have fire sale in them, again only
//  with the custom power ups option toggled on."*
//
//  🌟 THE FIRST HALF WAS ALREADY SHIPPING, and that was checked before writing
//  anything. zmqol_enable_fire_sale() (server, :9356) and its exact client twin
//  in zm_expanded.csc have carried Fire Sale on zm_transit and zm_highrise since
//  v1.54.0 - the two maps stock leaves it out of. Measured again against the
//  dump: include_powerup( "fire_sale" ) is called by zm_nuked:720, zm_prison:947,
//  zm_buried:1279 and zm_tomb:1173, on both the .gsc and the .csc side, and by
//  neither transit nor highrise. So "all maps can have fire sale" is already
//  true; the ONLY thing missing was the user's second clause - the row.
//
//  🛑 THE ROW IS ENFORCED IN THE DROP PREDICATE, NEVER AT REGISTRATION. Gating
//  include_powerup() would move a registerclientfield and that is exactly the
//  EXE_CLIENT_FIELD_MISMATCH this mod already shipped once - see the block above
//  zmqol_enable_zombie_blood, and the long client-side write-up above
//  zm_expanded.csc::zmqol_enable_fire_sale(). Both sides register
//  ( "toplayer", "powerup_fire_sale", 1, 2, "int" ) as a side effect of the
//  include LIST, so the two lists must stay identical no matter what this row
//  says. Re-pointing the predicate touches nothing that is registered.
//
//  🌟 THE BIT BUDGET IS NOT A CONCERN HERE, and that is measured rather than
//  hoped: per-map clientfield dumps give toplayer totals of 38 (transit classic)
//  and 33 (die rise) against Buried's 63, Origins' 61 and Mob's 50 - all of which
//  already carry powerup_fire_sale. toplayer is plainly not a 32-bit-capped set,
//  and the two maps being changed sit at the LOW end of the shipped range.
//
//  🛑 THE MAP GATE IS NOT COSMETIC. On zm_nuked / zm_prison / zm_buried / zm_tomb
//  Fire Sale is STOCK, so turning CUSTOM POWER-UPS off there must not remove it -
//  that would be the row deleting vanilla behaviour, which is the same mistake
//  the Blood Money block above documents for Origins. This only re-points the
//  predicate on the two maps where this mod is the reason Fire Sale exists.
//
//  📝 v2.7.3 - THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO SAY ALL THREE OF STOCK'S REFUSALS STILL
//  APPLY. Two of them do. func_should_drop_fire_sale() refuses while a Fire Sale
//  is already running, while level.chest_moves < 1, and while
//  level.disable_firesale_drop is set - and the middle one is now deliberately
//  NOT applied, because on a static-box survival location chest_moves can never
//  reach 1 and it blocked the drop for the whole game. See the banner over
//  zmqol_fs_should_drop() for the measurement.

//  zmqol_wait_network_frame  -  NETWORK FRAME PATCH                 (v2.0.6)
//
//  User, 2026-08-21: *"add 'NETWORK FRAME PATCH' as a toggleable option, because
//  that's another patch similar to the BACKSPEED PATCH ... the network frame
//  patch will match the console one ... like the B2OP script for example."*
//
//  🌟 WHAT A NETWORK FRAME IS, AND WHAT CONSOLE'S IS. wait_network_frame() is
//  the pacing primitive the whole zombies script layer waits on - spawns,
//  teleports, buildables, dog rounds. Stock ships two IDENTICAL copies,
//  maps\mp\zombies\_zm_utility and maps\mp\animscripts\zm_utility, and both read:
//
//        if ( numremoteclients() ) { ...wait for a snapshot ack... }
//        else                      wait 0.1;
//
//  The console figures are not guessed - T6-B2OP-PATCH, the community patch used
//  for world-record games, carries them as constants and a live checker:
//        b2op.gsc:18  #define NET_FRAME_SOLO 100
//        b2op.gsc:19  #define NET_FRAME_COOP  50
//  and evaluate_network_frame() (:2084) times a real frame and prints GOOD only
//  when solo measures 100 ms and coop measures 50 ms.
//
//  🌟 THE FIX IS ONE ADDED BRANCH, TAKEN FROM B2OP's fixed_wait_network_frame()
//  ( b2op.gsc:1412 ): in a ONE-PLAYER game, always wait the flat 100 ms and never
//  take the snapshot path. Stock only reaches its own 100 ms branch when
//  numremoteclients() is 0, and on Plutonium a solo game does not always look
//  like one - the same "every game looks online private" behaviour that already
//  breaks stock's solo detection elsewhere in this mod. When that happens, solo
//  paces off snapshot acknowledgement instead of the console's fixed frame.
//
//  🛑 OFF IS BYTE-EXACT STOCK, and that is why this is a replaceFunc that reads a
//  dvar rather than a replaceFunc applied conditionally. replaceFunc cannot be
//  undone for the session, so a conditional install could not be a live toggle;
//  reading the dvar inside the function makes the row flip on the very next
//  frame either way. With the row OFF the body below IS stock's body, copied
//  from the dump character for character.
//
//  🌟 IT CANNOT MAKE A CORRECT BUILD WORSE, and that is the safety argument.
//  The two functions differ in exactly one case: a 1-player game where
//  numremoteclients() is non-zero. On a build where that cannot happen, ON and
//  OFF are the same function. Coop is untouched in both.
//
//  🛑 STATED PLAINLY: B2OP DISABLES THIS ON MODERN PLUTONIUM. Its install is
//  `if (!is_plutonium_version(VER_3K))` with `#define VER_3K 3042` (b2op.gsc:16,
//  :141), i.e. it only patches builds OLDER than r3042 - so on r5344 B2OP does
//  not apply it, which is evidence that Plutonium fixed the underlying behaviour.
//  This ships anyway because the user asked for the row, and it ships **OFF by
//  default** so nothing changes until it is thrown. If the build is already
//  correct the row is a no-op; if it is not, it restores the console frame.
//
//  📝 BO2-Remix also overrides this ( src\scripts\zm\remix\_utility.gsc:9,
//  installed at Remix2.gsc:67 ) with a flat `wait 0.05` on EVERY game. That is
//  the COOP figure applied to solo as well, so by B2OP's own checker it would
//  read BAD in solo. B2OP's shape is the one ported here, deliberately.
//
//  🛑 BOTH COPIES ARE REPLACED. Replacing only _zm_utility's would leave the
//  animscripts copy on stock timing and the two halves of the game would pace
//  differently. maps\mp\animscripts\* resolves from a root script - proven, not
//  assumed: this file already calls maps\mp\animscripts\zm_death::flame_death_fx()
//  at :882 and ships on every map.

//          return false;
//
//  🌟 `level.chest_moves < 1` is the whole bug. chest_moves is incremented in
//  exactly one place - _zm_magicbox.gsc:1388, inside the "joker" branch that
//  flies the box away - and the box only flies to a chest whose
//  script_noteworthy is "move<n+1>" (:787). Town, Farm, Bus Depot and Diner have
//  ONE box location, so the box can never move, so chest_moves is 0 for the whole
//  game, so stock's predicate returns false forever. The include and the powerup
//  registration were both already correct; the drop could simply never fire.
//
//  So the chest_moves clause is dropped here and stock's other two refusals are
//  kept verbatim. A box that never moves is not a reason to withhold a Fire Sale

//  in this mod uses), and teach the mod's OWN Pack-a-Punch trigger about the
//  sale, because stock's discount only reaches stock's trigger. The 5000 -> 1000
//  number is Treyarch's, not a choice made here.
//
//  🛑 THE ART WAS THE ONLY THING MISSING, and it had to be shipped. Unlinker
//  --list over all eight zombies fastfiles (zm_transit, zm_nuked, zm_highrise,
//  zm_prison, zm_buried, zm_tomb, common_zm, patch_zm), 2026-09-05:
//        xmodel   zombie_pickup_bonfire   absent from every one
//        material zom_icon_bonfire        absent from every one
//  add_zombie_powerup() precaches the model for every INCLUDED power-up, so
//  including it without the model is fatal at load - the trap Fire Sale and
//  Blood Money both hit. Both assets now ship in mod.ff; see
//  zone_source\mod_bonfire.zone and zone_source\bonfire_donor\.
//
//  🌟 AND IT FIXES A STOCK ERROR ON THE WAY. _zm_powerups.gsc:30 calls
//  precacheshader( "zom_icon_bonfire" ) unconditionally on every map, so retail
//  BO2 prints  Could not load material "zom_icon_bonfire".  on every zombies
//  boot - six times in the user's own console_zm.log. Owning the name silences
//  it everywhere.
// ============================================================================
//  zmqol_bonfire_sale_enabled  -  WHICH MAPS, AND WHY EACH ONE
//
//  🛑 THE CLIENT TWIN IS zm_expanded.csc::zmqol_bonfire_sale_enabled() AND IT
//  MUST AGREE MAP FOR MAP. include_powerup() decides whether
//  add_zombie_powerup() survives its early-return, and that call registers
//  toplayer/powerup_bon_fire (2 bits) on BOTH sides. Disagree on any map and
//  every player is dropped with EXE_CLIENT_FIELD_MISMATCH before it starts.
//
//  zm_prison - EXCLUDED: the toplayer clientfield set is FULL. Mob classic is
//  zm_buried   50 stock bits and this mod's additions put it at 63; Buried
//              classic is the fullest map in the game at 63 stock and v2.9.30
//              already gave back all five of the mod's bits to get it there. 63
//              is the only total ever seen to boot (ERROR_CATALOGUE section 2:
//              63 boots, 66 fails, 71 fails), so there is no room for 2 more on
//              either map, and taking them would stop the map loading outright.
//              🛑 Do NOT "just try it" - that failure is fatal and silent about
//              its real cause (the field named in the error is whichever asks
//              last, usually a stock one).
//
//  zm_transit  - INCLUDED. 38 stock toplayer bits on classic and 27 on every
//  zm_highrise   survival location; Die Rise classic is 33; Nuketown is 18, the
//  zm_nuked      emptiest map in the game. Counting this mod's own additions in
//                puts them near 54 / 56 / 40, so all three have real headroom.
//
//  🛑 NUKETOWN WAS WRONGLY EXCLUDED IN v2.12.0, and the mistake is worth keeping
//  written down because the measurement LOOKED conclusive. v2.12.0 grepped the
//  map's static mapents (T6-Data-Archive ZM\Mapents\zm_nuked.d3dbsp) for
//  script_noteworthy "specialty_weapupgrade", found ZERO against 1 on Origins
//  and Die Rise and 3 on TranZit, and concluded Nuketown has no Pack-a-Punch.
//  The user corrected it, and they are right: NUKETOWN BUILDS ITS PERK MACHINES
//  FROM SCRIPT, NOT FROM MAPENTS -
//        zm_nuked_perks.gsc:37-40   level.nuked_perks[4].model =
//                                     "p6_anim_zm_buildable_pap";

//                                     "specialty_weapupgrade";
//                                   level.nuked_perks[4].turn_on_notify =
//                                     "Pack_A_Punch_on";
//        zm_nuked_perks.gsc:46/100  level.override_perk_targetname =
//                                     "zm_perk_machine_override";
//  so the machine is the fifth entry of the perk-arrival vehicle and its struct
//  never existed in the .d3dbsp at all. The override_perk_targetname branch is
//  right there in _zm_perks::perk_machine_spawn_init() and v2.12.0 had already
//  read it. 🛑 A GREP THAT FINDS NOTHING IS NOT A MEASUREMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE
//  ASKED WHETHER THE THING COULD EXIST SOMEWHERE THE GREP CANNOT SEE.
//  📝 zmqol_bs_pap_usable() would have declined the drop by itself if Nuketown
//  really had no machine, so the gate was never the risk - only the 2 wasted
//  bits, and Nuketown has 45 spare.

//
//  User, 2026-09-05: *"i gave myself the bonfire sale power up and it had no
//  announcer line, so make sure thats sorted out."*
//
//  🌟 THE SILENCE IS STOCK'S, AND IT IS TWO OMISSIONS, NOT ONE. Both read out
//  of the 2,093-file dump, neither inferred:
//
//    1. _zm_audio_announcer::init() registers ten announcer voxes at :13-22 -
//       carpenter, insta_kill, double_points, nuke, full_ammo, fire_sale,
//       minigun, zombie_blood, boxmove, dogstart. There is NO createvox for
//       "bonfire_sale". _zm_powerups.gsc:1147 announces every grabbed power-up
//       generically with leaderdialog( self.powerup_name ), so for this one it
//       asks for a key nobody registered and returns having played nothing.
//    2. start_fire_sale() opens with
//           level thread _zm_audio_announcer::leaderdialog( "fire_sale" )
//       (_zm_powerups.gsc:1167). start_bonfire_sale() (:1182) has no equivalent
//       - it goes straight to the loop sound and the 30 s timer.
//
//  What DOES fire is only the character line, powerup_vo( "firesale" ) at
//  :1042 - a survivor shouting "fire sale" 2-2.5 s after the grab. The
//  announcer half was never wired up at all. That character line is left
//  exactly as stock has it; this adds the missing half in front of it, which is
//  the same pairing a real Fire Sale already gives.
//
//  🌟 AND THE REAL RECORDING IS ALREADY IN BLACK OPS II. BO1 always had this
//  line - <BO1>\raw\maps\_zombiemode_audio.gsc:33
//      level.devil_vox["powerup"]["bonfire_sale"] = "bonfiresale";
//  under prefix "zmb_vox_ann_", i.e. zmb_vox_ann_bonfiresale. That alias is
//  shipped in T6: it is in zmb_highrise.english (Die Rise), 3.0 s of real
//  audio (48 kHz stereo, 275,636 B FLAC), and grep says it has ZERO references
//  across all 2,093 stock scripts - recorded, shipped, never called. The same
//  find as the Death Machine line this mod already re-ships, out of the same
//  bank and the same english\sound\vox\scripted\zmb\announcer\ folder, and its
//  60 alias fields are byte-identical to that row's. Nothing here is invented.
//  📝 The dumped death_machine payload compares byte-identical to the copy
//  already in sound\zmb\qol\, so this exact route is proven, not assumed.
//
//  Ships as vox_zmba_qol_powerup_bonfire_sale, plus the vox_zmba_sam_ twin that
//  Nuketown's announcer prefix needs and the _0 variant of each - the same
//  four-row shape zmqol_register_announcer_vox() documents above, all four
//  pointing at the one payload.
//
//  🛑 DELIBERATELY NOT REGISTERED WITH createvox. That would route the line
//  through leaderdialogonplayer(), which drops it outright whenever
//  self.zmbdialogactive is already 1 - the bug that silenced Blood Money on
//  Nuketown (v2.8.8). zmqol_play_announcer_line() is the route that was
//  measured to work; registering the vox as well would give the line twice on
//  the grabs where stock's path does fire.
//
//  🛑 HOOKED ON THE NOTIFY, NOT BY replaceFunc. start_bonfire_sale() opens with
//  level notify( "powerup bonfire sale" ) (:1184), and that notify appears
//  nowhere else in the dump, so waiting on it fires exactly once per sale and
//  copies none of Treyarch's body - there is nothing here that can drift out of
//  step with stock. The thread re-arms in the same frame it wakes, so a second
//  Bonfire Sale grabbed during the first is announced too, which is what stock's

//      zmqol_register_vulture_visionset() above.
//
//  🌟 THE TWO SIDES DO NOT HAVE TO REGISTER IN THE SAME ORDER, and that is
//  measured, not hoped: this mod already registers Vulture's eight clientfields
//  from main() on the server and from _zm_perks::init() on the client, and
//  Vulture ships and boots on five maps. Only the SET of names, versions, sets
//  and bit widths has to agree. (Visionset slots are immune by construction -
//  _visionset_mgr sorts its names alphabetically before assigning slot_index.)
//
//  ── COST, against the ceiling that was settled by a boot ─────────────────────
//
//      allplayers  +1   player_zombie_blood_fx
//      toplayer    +2   powerup_zombie_blood (add_zombie_powerup always takes 2)
//      toplayer    +1   visionset_lerp widens 3 -> 4 (lerp_step_count 15)
//      toplayer  +0-2   visionset_slot / overlay_slot may each gain a bit
//
//  The old arithmetic that said this would not fit on the classic maps is
//  WITHDRAWN. The user booted Buried CLASSIC on v1.64.0 - the fullest map in the
//  game at 63 toplayer bits stock, ~68 under this mod - and it played, with zero
//  EXE_CLIENT_FIELD / "out of space" lines in an 8,567-line log. The ceiling is
//  above the mod's real Buried total, so this fits everywhere.
//
//  ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT PORTED, and why that is parity ─────────────────
//
//  🛑 THE CHARACTER REACTION LINES ARE NOT SHIPPED. Origins records twelve -
//  vox_plr_0..3_powerup_zombie_blood_0..2 - and create_and_play_dialog() picks
//  one by the PLAYER'S CHARACTER INDEX. Shipping them would make Misty, Marlton,
//  Russman and Stuhlinger speak in the Origins cast's voices on every other map.
//  That is not the original behaviour, it is a new and worse one. With no vox
//  registered the call below returns silently, which is exactly what stock does
//  for any unregistered dialog type. The announcer line, which is character-
//  neutral, IS ported - see zmqol_register_announcer_vox().
//
//  📝 level.a_zombie_blood_entities stays empty off Origins. It holds the hidden
//  dig sites Zombie Blood reveals, and no other map has any - so the reveal loops
//  below iterate zero times. Nothing is missing; there is nothing to reveal.
//
//  📝 c_zom_tomb_german_player_fb is ONE model for all four characters - Origins
//  passes the same string regardless of who you are - so the port turns everyone
//  into an Origins German zombie. That is what the original does, so that is what
//  ships. (Unlike the VO above, the model is not character-keyed, so there is no
//  wrong-voice equivalent here.)

    //                                           has lerp_step_count 1. PhD's 5

    //                                           overlay.
    //      visionset_slot / overlay_slot   +2   both widen by one
    //  ...against only -1 freed (deadshot_perk, dropped by init_client_flags).
    //
    //  🌟 THE TWO *_lerp FIELDS ARE THE EXPENSIVE PART AND THEY ARE INVISIBLE IN
    //  ANY PER-MAP DUMP, because they do not exist in stock Mob at all. Eight
    //  bits appear out of nowhere the moment one high-step visionset or overlay
    //  is added to a map whose own effects all use a single step. Check for that
    //  before adding a visionset to any map, not just the bit count of the field
    //  you meant to add.
    //
    //  Zombie Blood's own share is only 3 of that: powerup_zombie_blood (2) plus
    //  widening visionset_lerp from 3 to 4 (its 15 lerp steps). Removing it frees
    //  exactly those 3.
    //
    //  ⚠️ 3 BITS MAY NOT BE THE WHOLE SHORTFALL, and that is stated rather than
    //  hidden. Mob appears in exactly ONE of the eleven kept console logs - the
    //  failed boot above - so it has not booted with this mod in the whole
    //  retained history. It has been at or over the line since v1.55.0 put
    //  Vulture on it; checkpoint 17's crash there was answered by dropping the
    //  5-bit vulture_perk_disease_meter and Mob was never re-booted to confirm.
    //  This change returns Mob to exactly its v1.64.0 state, which is unverified.
    //
    //  📝 IF MOB STILL FAILS, the next lever is Vulture, and it is justified on
    //  its own terms rather than as a budget raid: the perk ALREADY ships
    //  incomplete there (zmqol_vulture_has_disease_meter() returns 0 for
    //  zm_prison), which is the exact condition that took it off Origins in
    //  v1.59.0 - *"either the thing is added exactly how it'd work with its
    //  original implementation fully intact, no compromises, or you don't even
    //  bother"*. Turning it off on Mob frees 7 more bits (1 + 1 + the whole
    //  5-bit overlay_lerp, which no other Mob overlay needs). That is the user's
    //  call, not a change to make silently.
    //
    //  🛑 The client twin is zm_expanded.csc::zmqol_zombie_blood_enabled(). Both

//
//  User, 2026-08-11: *"one time whilst I had a zombie blood the zombies still
//  came for me and attacked me, all the fx visual and sound wise were working
//  just the actual functionality was scuffed"*.
//
//  🌟 THE FX WORKING IS THE DIAGNOSIS. `e_player.ignoreme = 1` is the FIRST
//  thing zombie_blood_powerup() does - three lines before any of the fx, the
//  visionsets or the clientfield. If the fx ran, the flag was set. So it was set
//  and then something CLEARED it, and this re-asserts it for the 30 seconds the
//  power-up owns.
//
//  🛑 IS THIS "TUNING A PORT"? No, and the distinction matters. The port is
//  otherwise byte-faithful to Origins' zombie_blood_powerup(), which relies on
//  the flag simply staying put for 30s. Something in this mod's environment does
//  not let it. Holding it at the value stock sets restores stock behaviour; it
//  does not make the power-up stronger, longer or wider than Treyarch's. That is
//  the additive gap-filling QUEUE.md's standing rule explicitly allows, not a
//  behaviour change.
//
//  📝 WHO CLEARS IT IS STILL UNKNOWN, so this also PRINTS. Core has at least one
//  unconditional writer - _zm.gsc:1381 player_spawn_protection() runs 3s of
//  ignoreme = 1 from onplayerspawned() and then ends with a bare
//  `self.ignoreme = 0`, which would wipe a power-up grabbed just after a spawn
//  or a revive - and _zm.gsc:2598 does the same on the respawn path. Neither was
//  proven to be what the user hit. The count in the log names the culprit's
//  timing on the next occurrence:
//      [zm_qol] zombie blood: ignoreme cleared (N) - re-asserted after Ns
//  If N is 1 and it lands ~3s after a spawn, it is spawn protection. If it
//  repeats steadily, it is a loop.
//
//  Ends on the same notifies the power-up itself uses, so a second pickup or the
//  power-up expiring stops it - it can never hold the flag past the effect.

//  zmqol_register_announcer_vox  -  THE THREE ANNOUNCER LINES        (v1.65.0)
//
//  User, 2026-08-11: *"make sure the announcer lines for them work as well, the
//  ones from origins so even on the other maps. Also, add a death machine
//  announcer line for the death machine power-up."*
//
//  🌟 THE MECHANISM DICTATES THE ALIAS NAMES, so they are not free-form.
//  _zm_powerups.gsc:1147 announces EVERY power-up generically, keyed on the
//  power-up's own name:
//      level thread _zm_audio_announcer::leaderdialog( self.powerup_name, ... )
//  and playleaderdialogonplayer() builds the alias as
//      game["zmbdialog"]["prefix"] + "_" + game["zmbdialog"][dialog]
//  with prefix "vox_zmba". So a ported line MUST be named vox_zmba_* - a zmqol_*
//  name can never be reached down this path. Mod-privacy is kept with a `qol_`
//  infix instead, which collides with nothing in any shipped bank.
//
//  🌟 AND IT MUST END IN _0. getleaderdialogvariant() calls
//  _zm_spawner::get_number_variants(), a soundexists( base + "_" + i ) loop. One
//  variant present -> full_alias = base + "_0", which is stock's own shape.
//
//  🛑 EACH LINE IS SHIPPED TWICE, UNDER BOTH NAMES - with the _0 and without -
//  and that is deliberate, not sloppiness. It closes the one branch that could
//  not be settled offline. get_number_variants() is a soundexists() loop, and
//  whether soundexists() can see an alias that lives in a MOD's own bank rather
//  than a stock one is not something any dump or log in this workspace answers.
//  The two outcomes are:
//      soundexists sees it  -> num_variants 1 -> plays <base>_0
//      soundexists misses it -> returns undefined -> plays <base> verbatim
//                               (playleaderdialogonplayer: `if ( !isdefined(
//                                variant ) ) full_alias = alias;`)
//  Shipping both names means either branch lands on a real alias. They are never
//  both played - the engine takes exactly one path - so the cost is three spare
//  rows in mod.all and the benefit is that a wrong guess about soundexists()
//  cannot silently mute all three lines. A missing alias is SILENT, never an
//  error, which is precisely why this is worth a belt and braces.
//
//  | createvox key        | alias the engine builds              | payload source |

//  | deathmachine         | vox_zmba_qol_powerup_death_machine_0 | zmb_highrise.english |
//
//  🛑 IT MUST RUN AFTER _zm_audio_announcer::init(), which opens with
//  `game["zmbdialog"] = []` - it would wipe anything written earlier. That init
//  is reached from _zm_audio::init() at _zm.gsc:149, and this mod's init() is not
//  ordered against it, so this polls instead of assuming. Polling is SAFE here
//  and is not the mistake the visionset registrations warn about: there is no
//  closing window - nothing ever clears game["zmbdialog"] again, and the first
//  power-up cannot be grabbed for many seconds.
//
//  ── PER-LINE NOTES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  ZOMBIE BLOOD. Core already does createvox( "zombie_blood",
//  "powerup_zombie_blood" ) on every map (_zm_audio_announcer.gsc:20), but the
//  alias it resolves to, vox_zmba_powerup_zombie_blood_0, exists ONLY in
//  zmb_tomb.english - measured by dumping the alias tables of zmb_tomb,
//  zmb_highrise, zmb_alcatraz, zmb_buried, zmb_nuked_real, zmb_classic_transit
//  and zmb_survival_transit. Off Origins get_number_variants() returns 0 and the
//  engine plays a name no bank has: silent, no error. Re-pointing the key at our
//  own copy is what makes it audible. Gated off zm_tomb so Origins keeps playing
//  Treyarch's alias through Treyarch's path.
//
//  BLOOD MONEY. 🛑 CORRECTS v1.64.0's WRITE-UP, which said the silence was
//  deliberate parity. That was measured on the wrong path. It is true that
//  createvox( "bonus_points_solo", ... ) appears nowhere in the 2,093-file stock
//  dump, so powerup_grab()'s powerup_vo( "bonus_points_solo" ) really does return
//  without playing - but ORIGINS REACHES THE LINE BY A DIFFERENT ROUTE ENTIRELY,
//  its dig script's own leaderdialog( "blood_money" ) (zm_tomb_dig.gsc:773). The
//  line exists and porting it is correct, not a tuning change.
//
//  📝 NO MAP GATE ON BLOOD MONEY, unlike the other two, and the reason is
//  specific. The key registered here is bonus_points_player - the POWER-UP's own
//  name, which is what :1147 passes - while Origins' dig registers a different
//  key, "blood_money". So this adds a line on the path stock leaves silent
//  (a natural drop) and does not touch the dig's, which keeps using Treyarch's
//  alias. Gating Origins out would instead leave the mod's own natural-drop
//  feature silent on exactly one map, which is the per-map half-implementation
//  this project does not ship.
//
//  DEATH MACHINE. 🛑 powerup_vo( "minigun" ) IS A DEAD END - do not use it. Core
//  registers createvox( "minigun", "powerup_death_machine" ), which resolves to
//  vox_zmba_powerup_death_machine, and that alias exists in NO bank in the game:
//  checked all seven zombie banks above plus the 96 base-game identifier files.
//  The only Death Machine announcer Treyarch actually recorded is Die Rise's
//  zmb_vox_ann_death_machine, which is not part of the zmbdialog system at all
//  and has ZERO references across all 2,093 stock scripts - recorded, shipped,
//  never wired up. It is re-shipped here under the vox_zmba_ shape so the generic
//  path can reach it.
//
//  📝 The key is "deathmachine", not "minigun", because that is what this mod
//  names its own power-up (see the deathmachine_powerup section above, and
//  add_zombie_powerup( "deathmachine", ... ) in init()). :1147 passes
//  self.powerup_name, so the vox has to be registered under that exact string.
//  No gate: no map plays this line in stock, so there is no baseline to preserve.

//  1. THE GLOW NEEDS GLOW-CAPABLE MATERIALS. Stock lights the corpse with a

//     the Victis crew only - Nuketown's CIA/CDC agents and Origins' Richtofen
//     crew have no `_g` material anywhere in the game.
//
//  2. 🛑 AND ORIGINS HAS NO ROOM FOR THE FIELD EVEN IF IT COULD USE IT. Its
//     `scriptmover` set is exactly 32/32 in both classic and survival - see the
//     count in zmqol_enable_whoswho(). Registering there is a boot crash, and

//      :162  evt_ww_disappear  at the corpse, when it bleeds out
//
//  🛑 BOTH ALIASES ARE DIE-RISE-ONLY - measured, not assumed. Plutonium's
//  soundaliaslists (a {alias: length_ms} table per map, common banks included)
//  carries evt_ww_appear and evt_ww_disappear under zm_highrise and under no
//  other map. A missing alias is SILENT and logs nothing, so this shipped as four
//  dead calls and looked like a working perk.
//
//  The fix is the one evt_ww_activate / evt_ww_looper already got (as
//  zmqol_ww_activate / zmqol_ww_looper, confirmed audible in game): re-ship
//  Treyarch's own payloads under mod-private names in this mod's own bank, so
//  nothing anywhere is shadowed. Payloads and alias parameters are Unlinker dumps
//  of zm_highrise.ff + zmb_highrise.all.sabl, copied row-for-row - ww_pop2 is the
//  appear and ww_pop the disappear, which the stock alias rows state outright and
//  the durations confirm (3382 / 2674 ms against the table's 3632 / 2924).
//
//  TWO HOOKS, AND NEITHER IS A GUESS ABOUT TIMING:
//
//  1. level._chugabud_post_respawn_override_func is TREYARCH'S OWN POINTER, called
//     on the player with the respawn origin from inside chugabud_fake_revive()
//     (:398-399) - after the disappear at :394, before the setorigin() at :415.
//     Nothing in between waits (chugabud_get_spawnpoint() is pure lookup, no wait
//     and no waittill anywhere in it), so both plays land in the same frame
//     stock's do, at the same two positions. zm_highrise_classic.gsc:77 is the
//     only setter in the whole game and this never runs on that map; the pointer
//     is chained rather than clobbered anyway.
//
//  2. chugabud_corpse_cleanup() has no hook, so it is replaced by a verbatim copy
//     with two lines added. It is 30 lines of straight-line code - no loops, no
//     branches beyond the two isdefined guards - so the copy carries no risk of
//     the kind a decompile of control flow would. The replacement is installed

//  zmqol_whoswho_overlay_*  -  v1.99.14. THE DOWNED-STATE SCREEN OVERLAY.
//
//  User, three rounds running: "who's who is still missing it's visual fx",
//  while confirming the AUDIO works. That combination proved the script half was
//  already correct - stock's activate_chugabud_effects_and_audio() (:745-762)
//  activates the visionset and writes both clientfields from the same four
//  consecutive lines, so if the sting and looper are audible, all of it ran.
//
//  🛑 THE CAUSE IS THIS MOD'S OWN NIGHT MODE, AND CHECKPOINT 60 NAMED IT AS THE
//  SUSPECT BEFORE THIS WAS CHASED. qol_options.gsc::qol_opt_night_on() sets
//
//        r_filmUseTweaks 1
//        vc_rgbh / vc_yl / vc_yh / vc_rgbl / vc_fsm / vc_fbm
//
//  and those vc_* dvars are the SAME colour-grade parameters a .vision file
//  carries - compare zm_whos_who.vision, which is literally a list of vc_LIB,
//  vc_RGBH, vc_YL, vc_SMR ... values. r_filmUseTweaks 1 tells the renderer to
//  use the dvars INSTEAD of the active visionset. So vsmgr_activate() succeeds,
//  the visionset becomes current, and the renderer ignores it. Silently.
//
//  That also explains why shipping the five Die-Rise-only assets in v1.99.13
//  changed nothing visible: they were necessary and they were not sufficient.
//
//  THE FIX: drive the overlay through the same channel night mode uses, which is
//  the one channel proven to reach the renderer on every map in this mod.
//  🛑 The values are NOT invented - they are read straight out of
//  vision/zm_whos_who.vision as dumped from zm_highrise.ff with the Unlinker,
//  and only the six vc_* dvars night mode itself proves exist are used. The
//  file's other entries (vc_SMR, vc_HMR, vc_MMR ...) are left alone rather than
//  guessed at.
//
//  📝 The stock filter pass and the visionset are NOT removed. They are the
//  authentic Die Rise path, their assets now ship (mod_whoswho.zone), and with
//  night mode off they do the work. This runs on top and is what makes the
//  effect survive night mode.

//  zmqol_whoswho_glow_model_watch  -  v1.99.17. THE CLONE'S GLOW, SOLVED.
//
//  User, with a reference shot of Die Rise: the downed clone should have a
//  bright orange rim glow. Ours had none, even after v1.99.16 delivered the
//  clientfield to the corpse - the log confirms "clone glow set on a
//  script_model corpse" fired, and still nothing glowed.
//
//  🌟 THE REASON IS THE MATERIALS, AND IT IS MEASURABLE. Stock's glow works by
//  writing a shader constant to the corpse:
//        self mapshaderconstant( localclientnum, 0, "scriptVector3" );
//        self setshaderconstant( localclientnum, 0, 1.0, 0, 0, 0 );
//  A shader constant only does something if the model's MATERIAL is authored to
//  read it. Dumping both clone models and reading the material names out of the
//  GLB settles it:
//
//    c_zom_player_reporter_dlc1_fb  (Die Rise) -> ..._arm_g, ..._body_g,
//                                                 ..._gear_g, ..._head_g
//    c_zom_player_reporter_fb       (TranZit)  -> ..._arm,   ..._body,
//                                                 ..._gear,  ..._head
//
//  🛑 The `_g` suffix is the glow-capable variant, and a fastfile sweep finds
//  every `mc/mtl_c_zom_player_*_g` material in **zm_highrise.ff and nowhere
//  else**. So off Die Rise the clone is built from materials that cannot glow,
//  and the shader constant lands on nothing. Silently, as ever.
//
//  THE FIX IS STOCK'S OWN AND IT WAS SITTING IN PLAIN SIGHT: Die Rise sets
//  self.whos_who_shader (zm_highrise.gsc:1185/1194/1203/1213), which
//  _zm_chugabud::chugabud_spawn_corpse() passes to spawn_player_clone() as
//  `forcemodel`. Nothing outside Die Rise ever sets it, so nothing outside Die
//  Rise gets the glow-capable model. Setting it is the whole fix.
//
//  🛑 zm_transit ONLY, and that is an asset limit, not a shortcut:
//    zm_transit  Victis crew, same four characters as Die Rise -> works
//    zm_nuked    CIA / CDC agents (zm_nuked.gsc:653-665). No `_g` materials
//                exist for them anywhere in the game.
//    zm_tomb     Richtofen / Dempsey / Nikolai / Takeo. A sweep for
//                `mc/mtl_c_zom_tomb*_g` returns nothing - Treyarch never made
//                glow materials for the Origins crew.
//  Rather than put a Victis body on a Nuketown agent or an Origins hero, those
//  two keep the plain clone. Reported, not silently bodged.
//
//  📝 The index mapping is TranZit's own switch (zm_transit.gsc:1155-1181), not
//  Die Rise's assumed to carry over - they happen to agree: 0 oldman,

//
//  User: "my downed character model is missing the glow sort of fx".
//
//  🌟 THE CAUSE, MEASURED, NOT GUESSED. Stock lights the clone with
//        corpse setclientfield( "clientfield_whos_who_clone_glow_shader", 1 );
//  (_zm_chugabud.gsc:72) and that field is registered on the **actor** set.
//  But look at how the clone is created - _zm_clone.gsc:27-38:
//
//        spawner = getent( "fake_player_spawner", "targetname" );
//        if ( isdefined( spawner ) )  { clone = spawner spawnactor(); clone.isactor = 1; }
//        else                         { clone = spawn( "script_model", origin ); clone.isactor = 0; }
//
//  🛑 So the clone is an ACTOR only on maps that ship a `fake_player_spawner`
//  entity. Dumped `mapents` with the Unlinker and counted the occurrences:
//
//        zm_highrise   1     <- Die Rise, where Who's Who is native. Actor.
//        zm_transit    0     <- script_model
//        zm_tomb       0     <- script_model
//
//  An `actor`-set clientfield written to a script_model is delivered to nothing,
//  silently. That is why the glow works on Die Rise and on no other map - and it
//  is the same silent-failure shape as every other Who's Who defect in this saga.
//
//  THE FIX: a `scriptmover` twin of the same field, set on the corpse when the
//  corpse is not an actor. The callback is stock's OWN
//  _zm_perks::chugabud_whos_who_shader - core client code, so it can be named
//  directly and nothing is reimplemented.
//
//  📝 Bit cost is on the `scriptmover` set, not `actor`. That matters: the actor
//  set is the scarce one (Origins sits at 32/32 after Who's Who, which is why
//  Buried is excluded), while scriptmover already carries Vulture's 4-bit field
//  here with room to spare.

//
//  and clone_damage_func() is what notifies "player_revived" for the four

//  🛑 That is the engine's ACTOR damage callback. A script_model never goes
//  through it, so on a script_model corpse clone_damage_func is dead code.
//
//  And the corpse is a script_model on every map but Die Rise. Same
//  fake_player_spawner census as the glow, re-dumped from mapents to be sure:
//
//        zm_highrise   1     <- actor.       Stock revive works, natively.
//        zm_transit    0     <- script_model. Dead.
//        zm_nuked      0     <- script_model. Dead.
//        zm_buried     0     <- script_model. Dead.

//      _weaponobjects.gsc:495-502     + maxhealth, and switches on weaponname

//  against _zm_ai_basic.gsc:462 - the two disagree about whether slots 6/7 are
//  (modelname, tagname) or (tagname, modelname), but BOTH put **weaponname at
//  slot 9**, which is the only one read here.
//
//  🛑 WHY HEALTH IS KEPT TOPPED UP. Stock's clone_damage_func returns
//  `idamage = 0` - the actor corpse takes no damage at all. Restoring health on
//  every hit is how a script_model reproduces that, and it is why a zombie

//  🛑 v1.99.43's watcher was armed and it recorded NOTHING. Measured, not
//  assumed: the 2026-08-18 03:17 TranZit session logged
//  "whoswho: clone glow set on a script_model corpse" - and that print sits
//  behind the same two guards, in the same loop, as the arming call, so the
//  damage watcher was running - yet the log carries not one
//  "whoswho corpse: damage weapon=" line while the user shot the body
//  repeatedly with the Pack-a-Punched knife. setcandamage() is not the missing
//  piece: a character xmodel carries no collision of its own, so the bolt goes
//  straight through the body and no damage event is ever raised on it.
//
//  🌟 SO USE THE HOOK TREYARCH USES FOR THIS EXACT WEAPON. Every ballistic
//  knife in zombies is a weapon OBJECT with a watcher -
//  _zm_weapons.gsc:462-463 registers "knife_ballistic" and
//  "knife_ballistic_upgraded" (Bowie and tazer-knuckle variants are added by
//  _zm_weap_bowie.gsc:17-18 and _zm_weap_tazer_knuckles.gsc:24-25 on the maps
//  that have them), and _zm_weap_ballistic_knife::on_spawn ends with
//
//        player notify( "ballistic_knife_stationary", retrievable_model, normal, prey );
//
//  That notify is not a guess: it is what puts the pick-your-knife-back-up
//  prompt in the world, and that prompt demonstrably works in game today, so
//  the path provably runs. It hands over the model that marks EXACTLY where the
//  bolt came to rest (retrievable_model.origin = the "stationary" endpos), the
//  entity it stuck into if any (prey), and the weapon it came from
//  (retrievable_model.name = watcher.weapon).
//
//  🌟 THE HIT TEST IS STOCK'S TOO, TWICE OVER.
//    - _zm_weap_staff_revive.gsc:45-64 - Origins' revive staff, the one other
//      "shoot a projectile at a downed body to revive it" in the game - does not
//      test a hitbox either. It takes the impact point and reviving anyone
//      within 32 units of it (n_closest_dist_sq = 1024).
//    - _zm_weap_thundergun.gsc:187-190 - the cylinder test used here verbatim:
//      pointonsegmentnearesttopoint( view_pos, end_pos, test_origin ), then
//      compare the distance to the radius.
//  Eye -> resting point is the bolt's flight line, so a bolt that passes
//  through the body and sticks in the wall behind counts, which is what Die
//  Rise's actor hitbox does natively. 32 units is the revive staff's own radius.
//
//  📝 The four upgraded names are stock's list from _zm_clone::clone_damage_func;
//  an un-upgraded knife does not revive there and does not revive here.
//
//  📝 Lifetime is the corpse. chugabud_corpse_cleanup() deletes it

//  🌟 v1.99.19 - THE COPY IS GONE. WE WERE SWITCHING OFF THE THING THAT WORKS.
//
//  v1.99.18 lifted night mode's exposure and the red STILL did not show. That
//  ruled out brightness and left one candidate, and it was sitting in this
//  function's own first line since v1.99.14:
//
//        self setclientdvar( "r_filmUseTweaks", 1 );
//
//  🛑 r_filmUseTweaks is "Overide film effects with tweak dvar values"
//  (Plutonium's dvar_descriptions.json). Setting it to 1 makes the renderer
//  ignore EVERY VISIONSET - including stock's own zm_whos_who, the exact effect
//  this function exists to produce. So every version since v1.99.14 has turned
//  the real mechanism off and then tried to hand-reproduce it through the dvars,
//  on maps where the real mechanism would have worked unaided.
//
//  🌟 AND THE REAL MECHANISM IS FULLY WIRED UP. Both halves were verified before
//  this rewrite, not assumed:
//    * server - stock's own _zm_perks::turn_chugabud_on() (:1448-1449) calls
//      vsmgr_register_info( "visionset", "zm_whos_who", ... ), gated on
//      level.vsmgr_prio_visionset_zm_whos_who, which zmqol_enable_whoswho() sets.
//    * client - zm_expanded.csc::perks_register_clientfield() registers the
//      twin (v1.63.1), in the one place in that script that runs inside the
//      visionset manager's window.
//    * 🌟 AND THE FACT THAT THE MAP BOOTS AT ALL IS THE PROOF THEY AGREE.
//      _visionset_mgr::finalize_type_clientfields() derives visionset_slot's bit
//      width from how many visionsets each side registered; one side short is
//      "visionset_slot ... [CLIENT: 1 SERVER: 2]" at load, which is exactly the
//      error v1.63.1 hit and fixed. No error now = symmetric now.
//    * the vision file itself, vision/zm_whos_who.vision, ships inside mod.ff
//      (confirmed with Unlinker --list on the DEPLOYED file).
//
//  So there is nothing to reproduce. stock's activate_chugabud_effects_and_audio()
//  already calls vsmgr_activate( "visionset", "zm_whos_who", self ) - and we know
//  that function runs, because its audio siblings are confirmed working in game.
//
//  THIS FUNCTION'S WHOLE JOB IS NOW TO GET NIGHT MODE OUT OF THE WAY: drop the
//  three overrides that make the renderer ignore visionsets and dim the picture,
//  and put them back on the way out. Treyarch's own grade then renders through
//  Treyarch's own path, byte for byte, on every map.
//
//  📝 The 23 copied values are deleted rather than kept as a fallback. Two

//          }
//      }
//
//  🛑 Note what happens when that inner isdefined FAILS: self.lives has ALREADY
//  been decremented and there is no else - so the player silently falls through
//  to the ordinary down, one life poorer. "Perk equipped, nothing happened, game
//  over" is precisely the shape of a missing level.chugabud_laststand_func.
//
//  Everything on the give side checks out statically, and was re-read rather
//  than assumed:
//    - give_perk() (our override, line ~4780) does set self.lives = 1 for
//      specialty_finalstand, same as stock.
//    - the .give<perk> command routes through _zm_perks::give_perk, which is
//      the function we replace, so it gets that block.
//    - _zm_perks::init() threads turn_chugabud_on() off
//      level.zombiemode_using_chugabud_perk, which we set in main(), before
//      init() runs.
//    - turn_chugabud_on()'s FIRST statement is _zm_chugabud::init(), and that
//      function's first statement sets level.chugabud_laststand_func - so even
//      a thread that dies on the loadfx calls two lines later should leave the
//      pointer set.
//
//  So the static read says it should work and the game says it does not, which
//  is the point where guessing again would cost another release (checkpoint 18
//  section 1). This verifies instead: it reports the pointer's real state to the
//  log, and if it is genuinely missing it installs it, which is a no-op whenever
//  stock did its job. _zm_chugabud::init() is safe to name from a root script -
//  _zm_perks.gsc calls it on every map, so the file resolves everywhere.
//
//  If the next log says OK and Who's Who still does nothing, the pointer is not
//  the cause and the damage path is - look at the tank first, since
//  zm_tomb_tank::tank_ran_me_over does disableinvulnerability() then
//  dodamage( self.health + 1000 ).

//  zmqol_enable_vulture  -  the 11th and LAST perk
//
//  Vulture Aid is Buried's, and with it the Wunderfizz can offer every perk
//  Black Ops II Zombies has. Enabled on the five maps that never shipped it;
//  Buried is excluded because it enables the perk itself, and re-running the
//  registration there would fight its own.
//
//  Everything about this mirrors zmqol_enable_electric_cherry() above, on
//  purpose - it is the same problem shape and the same three traps:
//
//  1. 🛑 TEST FOR THE BEHAVIOUR, NOT THE STRUCT. _register_undefined_perk()
//     creates level._custom_perks["specialty_nomotionsensor"] as a bare empty
//     struct the moment anything so much as names the perk, and wunderfizz.gsc's
//     getPerks() names it on every map. Guarding on the struct existing would
//     therefore skip the real registration and leave the perk cosmetic - the
//     exact half-dead state Electric Cherry was in. player_thread_give is the
//     thing register_perk_threads() actually sets, so that is what is checked.
//
//  2. 🛑 init_vulture() MUST RUN EXACTLY ONCE. It calls registerclientfield
//     eight times and a second call is fatal ("already registered"). Stock only
//     ever reaches it through vulture_perk_machine_think(), which _zm_perks::init()
//     threads - so it is called here, once, behind its own flag, and the
//     perk_machine_thread pointer is then cleared so init() cannot call it again.
//     Clearing that costs nothing: the machine loop only drives a physical
//     Vulture Aid machine, and on these five maps there is none - the Wunderfizz
//     is what hands the perk out.
//
//  3. 🛑 THE CLIENT MUST REGISTER THE IDENTICAL SET. Eight clientfields on the
//     server and a different eight on the client is EXE_CLIENT_FIELD_MISMATCH
//     for everyone before the map starts. zm_expanded.csc::zmqol_enable_vulture()
//     is the other half and is deliberately written to the same shape, with the
//     same map list, so the two cannot drift.
//
//  Called from perks(), which runs in main() - clientfields have to be
//  registered before the first snapshot, so this cannot move to init().
//
//  🛑 NOT verified in game yet. Requires build_ff.bat.
// ============================================================================
// ============================================================================
//  zmqol_vulture_enabled  -  THE ONE map list, asked by every site
//
//  🛑 TWO MAPS PHYSICALLY CANNOT TAKE THIS PERK, AND THEY RAN OUT OF DIFFERENT
//  BUDGETS. Both errors are quoted because they look unrelated and are the same
//  problem:
//
//    zm_tomb   Trying to assign 1 bits for netfield zone_capture_zombie
//              but Client Field Set ACTOR is out of space.
//    zm_prison Trying to assign 5 bits for netfield vulture_perk_disease_meter
//              but Client Field Set TOPLAYER is out of space.
//
//  Every clientfield SET has its own fixed bit budget. Vulture Aid registers
//  eight fields spread across four sets, so it can hit the ceiling in more than
//  one place, and which ceiling it hits depends on what the MAP already spends:
//
//    Origins is heavy on ACTOR   - templars, crusaders, capture zones, panzer -
//                                  and vulture_perk_actor is 2 bits.
//    Mob is heavy on TOPLAYER    - afterlife, the plane, the shield, brutus -
//                                  and vulture_perk_disease_meter is 5 bits.
//
//  Neither is fixable by reordering or by a lower version number. The budget is
//  the budget, and the field that errors is whichever one asks LAST - so on both
//  maps the name in the message is the map's own field, not ours. Read those
//  errors as "someone before me used the space", never as "this field is broken".
//
//  There IS a way back for both, and it is the same way: the two expensive fields
//  drive only cosmetics - vulture_perk_actor is the zombie eye glow and stink
//  trail, vulture_perk_disease_meter is the stink meter - so skipping just those
//  on BOTH sides would leave a working perk minus one visual each. The client
//  half lives in clientscripts\mp\zombies\_zm_perk_vulture.csc, which this
//  project ships as COMPILED bytecode; it would have to be decompiled, edited and
//  re-shipped as raw text. A real option and a bigger job than a boot fix.
//
//  📝 A clientfield budget is a shared global resource with no per-mod share.
//  Budget against the FULLEST map, not the emptiest, and expect different maps to
//  run out in different sets.
//
//  🛑 AND IT LIVES IN ONE FUNCTION FOR A REASON. v1.49.0 wrote this list into
//  zmqol_enable_vulture() and its client twin but forgot
//  zmqol_register_vulture_visionset(), which then registered a server-side
//  overlay the client did not have and turned a boot crash into a different boot
//  crash. A list copied into three places drifts; it drifted the first time it
//  was copied.
// ============================================================================
//  ✅ RESOLVED (v1.55.0) - ORIGINS AND MOB ARE NO LONGER EXCLUDED.
//
//  The paragraph above says the way back is to skip just the one expensive
//  cosmetic field on each map, on BOTH sides, and calls the client half "a
//  bigger job than a boot fix" because the client script ships as compiled
//  bytecode. That job is done:
//
//    zm_tomb    drops vulture_perk_actor          (2 bits, actor)   - eye glow
//                                                                     + stink trail
//    zm_prison  drops vulture_perk_disease_meter  (5 bits, toplayer) - stink meter
//
//  Server side: maps\mp\zombies\_zm_perk_vulture.gsc already ships raw, so the
//  two registrations and all seven use sites are gated there directly on
//  zmqol_vulture_has_actor_field() / zmqol_vulture_has_disease_meter().
//
//  Client side: the compiled .csc is NOT replaced. Only init_vulture is
//  re-implemented, in scripts\zm\zm_expanded.csc - read the long comment above
//  zmqol_init_vulture_trimmed() there for why shipping the decompiled .csc raw
//  was tried and rejected (the decompile is lossy, and it would have degraded
//  the three maps where the perk already works).
//
//  Each map loses exactly one visual and keeps the perk.

    //
    //  WHY IT EXISTS. TranZit classic dies at `vulture_perk_toplayer`, and the
    //  source-derived bit accounting cannot be trusted to size the hole: it
    //  totals TranZit at 65 while Buried classic runs at >=71 and boots. About
    //  28 bits of TranZit's real usage are unexplained, and every offline
    //  search for them came back empty (the mod's own registerclientfield
    //  calls, weapon includes, buildables, powerups, the replaced/ folder).
    //
    //  This dvar buys ONE number that no amount of reading can produce: does
    //  TranZit classic load with Vulture absent?
    //    - loads  => Vulture alone is the overflow, deficit <= 10 bits
    //                (its 9 + the overlay_lerp 4->5 its 31-step stink forces)
    //    - fails  => the next error names the next field, which is another
    //                exact zero-free-bits measurement, and Vulture is not the
    //                whole story
    //
    //  🛑 IT IS A PROBE, NOT A FIX, AND NOT A SHIPPED OPTION. Nothing decides
    //  to leave Vulture off anywhere on the strength of this dvar; it exists to
    //  size the problem. No degraded variant gets shipped either way.
    //
    //  🛑 THE CLIENT TWIN IS zm_expanded.csc::zmqol_vulture_enabled() AND IT

    //
    //  🛑 PROVEN IMPOSSIBLE, not assumed. Vulture needs bits in two sets that

    //
    //      vulture_perk_scriptmover   4 bits   scriptmover   Origins 32/32
    //      vulture_perk_actor         2 bits   actor         Origins 31/32
    //
    //  1. The ceiling is 32 and it is measured, not inferred: across all 48
    //     per-map dumps in Black Ops 2 Grand Resources\...\Clientfields\, NO
    //     map exceeds 32 in either set - and the map that reaches exactly 32 in
    //     scriptmover IS Origins.
    //  2. The ceiling was also hit for real by this project:
    //         zm_tomb: Trying to assign 1 bits for netfield zone_capture_zombie
    //         but Client Field Set ACTOR is out of space
    //     which is Origins' 31 stock bits plus vulture_perk_actor's 2.
    //  3. None of Origins' 32 scriptmover bits belong to this mod. They are
    //     element_glow_fx (4), staff_charger (3), powerup_fx (3),
    //     play_artillery_barrage (2), perk_bottle_cycle_state (2), bryce_cake
    //     (2) and the rest - the staffs, the generators, the tank. Freeing 4
    //     means deleting an Origins system to bolt on a perk, which is a worse
    //     compromise than not shipping the perk.
    //
    //  v1.55.0 shipped it here anyway with vulture_perk_actor and
    //  vulture_perk_scriptmover dropped, calling it "each map loses exactly one
    //  visual and keeps the perk". In practice Origins lost the zombie eye
    //  glow, the stink trail, the stink pile and (from v1.58.4) the meter. That
    //  is four missing visuals, and the user found every one of them.
    //
    //  📝 Nothing else needs changing when this returns 0. getPerks() gates
    //  Vulture on level._custom_perks[ "specialty_nomotionsensor" ], which is
    //  only defined by the enable path this guards, so the Wunderfizz list
    //  drops to 11 by itself. The visionset registration asks this same
    //  function. That is exactly why the list lives in ONE place.

    // ========================================================================
    //  v1.83.0 - VULTURE IS OFF ON TRANZIT. Same rule, different set.
    //
    //  🛑 THIS IS THE FIX FOR THE ONLY MAP THE MOD COULD NOT BOOT, and the user
    //  had to report it twice because it was filed as "known" instead of open:
    //
    //      Trying to assign 1 bits for netfield vulture_perk_toplayer
    //      but Client Field Set toplayer is out of space.
    //
    //  WHY THE ERROR NAMES THIS FIELD, AND WHY THAT IS THE ANSWER. The boot log
    //  puts the COM_ERROR *after* every init() has run - after
    //  `GSC Executed "scripts/zm/zm_transit/zm_transit::init()"` - so bits are
    //  assigned when the clientfield system finalizes, walking the registration
    //  order. The field the error names is therefore the exact point at which
    //  the running total crosses the ceiling: everything registered BEFORE
    //  vulture_perk_toplayer fits, and Vulture's block is the overflow.
    //
    //  WHAT TURNING IT OFF HERE GIVES BACK ON TRANZIT - 10 toplayer bits:
    //        vulture_perk_toplayer        1
    //        sndVultureStink              1
    //        vulture_perk_disease_meter   5
    //        perk_vulture                 2
    //        overlay_lerp 5 -> 4          1   (the 31-step vulture_stink_overlay
    //                                          is the widest overlay the mod
    //                                          adds; without it the next widest
    //                                          is zombie blood at 15 steps)
    //  plus 2 actor, 4 scriptmover, 1 zbarrier and 1 world bit it no longer asks
    //  for. Every one of those is gated on this function, which is why the list
    //  lives in one place.
    //
    //  🛑 WHY NOT SHRINK SOMETHING INSTEAD. vulture_perk_disease_meter's 5 bits
    //  could be moved to `allplayers`, where TranZit uses 25 of 32. That is a
    //  tune of a stock field, which this project does not do, and it frees 5
    //  where 10 are needed. Narrowing the perk fields is not available either -
    //  they are 2 bits wide on EVERY map because that is the width stock
    //  hardcodes in perks_register_clientfield(), and perk_pause() writes the
    //  value 2 into them, which 1 bit cannot hold.
    //
    //  🛑 CORRECTED v2.9.13. This used to say they were 2 bits "because TranZit
    //  ships emp_grenade_zm, which is stock's own rule". That was WRONG on both
    //  counts: stock's function hardcodes 2 and never mentions the EMP, and the
    //  game's own per-map clientfield dumps show 2 bits on all six maps
    //  including the five with no EMP. The EMP conditional was this mod's own
    //  invention and has been removed - see the block on
    //  perks_register_clientfield() itself.
    //
    //  📝 TranZit keeps 11 perks. getPerks() gates Vulture on
    //  level._custom_perks[ "specialty_nomotionsensor" ], defined only by the
    //  enable path this guards, so the Wunderfizz list drops by itself.
    //
    //  🛑 The client twin is zm_expanded.csc::zmqol_vulture_enabled(). Both must
    //  agree or every player is dropped with EXE_CLIENT_FIELD_MISMATCH.
    // ========================================================================
    //  v1.84.0 - AND ONLY ON CLASSIC. The survival locations keep all twelve.
    //
    //  User, 2026-08-13: *"the perk limit has been dropped to 11 for diner, and
    //  presumably the other survival maps as well, those maps were working fine
    //  with all 12 perks."* Correct - v1.83.0 gated on the map name alone, and
    //  every TranZit survival and grief location is also `zm_transit`, so they
    //  all lost a perk they had room for.
    //
    //  🌟 MEASURED, from the per-map dumps in
    //  Black Ops 2 Grand Resources\...\Clientfields\ - stock toplayer bits for
    //  every shipped zm_transit configuration:
    //
    //        38   zclassic  transit      <- the only one that overflows
    //        28   zgrief    (all 7 locations)
    //        27   zstandard (all 7 locations: diner, town, farm, power,
    //                        cornfield, tunnel, transit)
    //        24   dr_zcleansed
    //
    //  Classic carries ELEVEN more stock bits than any survival location, which
    //  is exactly why the survivals were running twelve perks happily while
    //  classic could not load at all. Vulture needs 10. The survivals have room.
    //
    //  🛑 WHY ui_zm_mapstartlocation AND NOT g_gametype. The failing boot log
    //  printed both, from replaced\utility.gsc::struct_class_init:
    //        [zm_qol] struct_class_init - gametype=zclassic location=transit
    //  so either would identify it - but `g_gametype` is a server dvar and this
    //  test has to give the SAME answer inside zm_expanded.csc. The client half
    //  already reads `ui_zm_mapstartlocation` in four places, and the comment
    //  above zmqol_wallbuy_match_string() documents why that dvar in particular
    //  is safe here: `_zm::init()` has not assigned level.scr_zm_* yet at this
    //  point, and both sides read this very dvar later, so they always agree.
    //
    // ========================================================================
    //  v1.89.0 - AND THE GAMETYPE TOO. 🛑 THIS CORRECTS A WRONG CLAIM THAT
    //  SHIPPED IN v1.84.0's COMMENT HERE, WHICH READ:
    //
    //      "zstandard/zgrief at location "transit" are not reachable from the
    //       menus ... they fall on the safe side of this test"
    //
    //  THE FIRST HALF IS FALSE. **Bus Depot is `zstandard` at location
    //  `transit`** and it is on the survival menu. The user played it
    //  2026-08-13 and the boot log printed both configurations back to back:
    //
    //      [zm_qol] struct_class_init - gametype=zclassic  location=transit
    //      [zm_qol] struct_class_init - gametype=zstandard location=transit
    //
    //  So the location-only test caught Bus Depot as well and took a perk it
    //  had room for - the SAME defect as v1.83.0, which cost every TranZit
    //  survival a perk, just narrowed to the one location that shares classic's
    //  name. Bus Depot is 27 stock toplayer bits; classic is 38. Vulture needs
    //  10. Only classic overflows.
    //
    //  🛑 ui_gametype, and it is as safe as the dvar beside it - VERIFIED, not
    //  assumed. zmqol_wallbuy_match_string() reads these TWO dvars together, on
    //  BOTH halves (zm_expanded.csc:439 and locs\loc_common.gsc:157), at
    //  struct_class_init time - strictly earlier than this - and the wallbuys
    //  it drives work today. Its comment records why: _zm::init() has not
    //  assigned level.scr_zm_* yet this early, and both sides read these very
    //  same dvars later, so they cannot disagree.

//  perk the map never registered can never be offered. Reported in game: after
//  eight perks the machine says "You have all 8 perks".
//
//  Stock enables it on Mob of the Dead (zm_prison.gsc:111) and Origins
//  (zm_tomb.gsc:180) only, so those two are EXCLUDED here - registering a perk
//  twice re-registers its clientfields, which is an error in itself.
//
//  maps\mp\zombies\_zm_perk_electric_cherry is a CORE module, so referencing it
//  from this root script is legal under AI_CONTEXT rule 2. Its assets are not
//  core, though - models, fx, the bottle weapon and the client .csc all come
//  from zm_prison(.ff/_patch.ff) via zone_source\mod_locations.zone.
//
//  🛑 WHY init_electric_cherry() IS CALLED HERE AND NOT LEFT ALONE.
//  enable_...for_level() only REGISTERS the perk. The clientfield
//  "electric_cherry_reload_fx" is registered by init_electric_cherry(), while the
//  CLIENT registers that field unconditionally through register_perk_init_thread.
//  Left alone the two sides can disagree by exactly one field and everyone is
//  dropped with EXE_CLIENT_FIELD_MISMATCH. Calling it here puts the server-side
//  registration in the same legal window - identical in shape to
//  zmqol_register_divetonuke_visionset above, and to
//  [[t6-visionset-registration-timing]].
//
//  🛑 AND WHY perk_machine_thread IS THEN CLEARED.
//  v1.18.1 shipped with the call above and nothing else, and every one of these
//  four maps died on load with:
//        COM_ERROR (1) Attempt to register ClientField electric_cherry_reload_fx
//        failed. Client Field set 'allplayers' either already contains a field
//        called electric_cherry_reload_fx, ...
//  The comment that used to sit here claimed the only stock caller of
//  init_electric_cherry() is electric_cherry_perk_machine_think(), which "runs
//  only once an Electric Cherry MACHINE is being processed". That is wrong.
//  _zm_perks::init() lines 101-110 thread EVERY registered custom perk's
//  perk_machine_thread with no check that any machine entity exists:
//        if ( isdefined( level._custom_perks[a_keys[i]].perk_machine_thread ) )
//            level thread [[ level._custom_perks[a_keys[i]].perk_machine_thread ]]();
//  and init_electric_cherry() is that thread's first statement. So it fired a
//  second time and took the server down.
//
//  Clearing the pointer is what stops it: the loop above is guarded on
//  isdefined(). Nothing is lost - the thread's whole body operates on
//  getentarray( "vendingelectric_cherry", ... ), which is empty on these maps,
//  then blocks forever on `level waittill( "electric_cherry_on" )`. The perk's
//  real behaviour (reload attack, perk_lost) is registered separately by
//  register_perk_threads() and is untouched.
//
//  Deleting our own init_electric_cherry() call instead would ALSO fix the crash,
//  but it would make registration depend on _zm_perks::init() reaching that loop -
//  and it does not always: it early-returns when vending_triggers.size < 1. That
//  gate is the documented cause of an earlier mismatch on this project, see
//  zm_qol\scripts\zm\zm_tomb\zm_tomb.gsc:111-124. Registering in main() and
//  removing the duplicate is not exposed to it.

//  zmqol_dim_cherry_arcs  -  Electric Cherry's kill arc uses the SECONDARY
//  tesla shock (v2.9.30)
//
//  User, 2026-09-01: electrified zombies cause blinding screen flashes. Stock's
//  electric_cherry_death_fx() plays level._effect["tesla_shock"] on every
//  zombie the reload shock KILLS - at an empty clip that is every zombie
//  within 128 units, each one a 13-element / 10-sprite flash (measured from
//  BO1's raw .efx sources, which this T6 family derives from; peak sprite
//  size 525). Stock's own STUN arc, fx_zombie_tesla_shock_secondary, is the
//  same family at 7 elements / 5 sprites / peak 425 - Treyarch's lighter arc.
//
//  THE MECHANISM: repoint the _effect key, not replaceFunc. The only reader
//  of level._effect["tesla_shock"] in all 2,093 stock scripts is
//  electric_cherry_death_fx() (grepped, not assumed), and it is called
//  UNQUALIFIED from electric_cherry_reload_attack() in the same file - which
//  is replaceFunc failure mode #1 (dev CLAUDE.md §4): a replace would
//  silently not take for those calls. The key repoint reaches every caller.
//
//  No loadfx here - both handles are loaded by stock init_electric_cherry()
//  (lines 44-45), so this only copies an already-loaded handle and cannot hit
//  the loadfx-after-init window. The wait exists because cherry's init timing
//  differs between the ported maps (our perks(), main window) and its native
//  maps (Mob/Origins, machine think inside _zm_perks::init()); nobody can
//  drink the perk within the first seconds, so the poll always wins the race
//  that matters. If cherry is not on this map the keys never appear and this
//  exits after ~10s having touched nothing.
//
//  📝 Server-side only ON PURPOSE: network_safe_play_fx_on_tag() sends the fx
//  handle the server chose, and the zombie-attached arcs are all
//  server-played. No clientfield, no client twin, no symmetry risk.

//  Vanguard Perk Animation  (perk pop-up HUD with icon + name + description)
//  Original by techboy04gaming
//  Perk names / descriptions added by NewMartinLag
//  Source: https://github.com/NewMartinLag/Vanguard-Perk-HUD-Description
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Added 2026-07-30. REPLACES the old custom_perkanimuncompiled "perkHUD()"
//  pop-up, which never reliably showed in-game.
//
//  Key design difference vs. the old one: this does NOT hook give_perk().
//  It listens for the native "perk_acquired" notify, which stock
//  _zm_perks::give_perk (and our give_perk() override above) fires AFTER the
//  perk has actually been awarded - so it can't interfere with the purchase
//  logic, and it also fires for perks granted by other means (digs, easter
//  eggs, rounded rewards), which the old give_perk-hooked version missed or
//  double-handled. The notify carries no parameter, so the perk id is read
//  back from the last entry of self.perks_active (appended by give_perk()
//  right before it notifies).
//
//  Merged-file renames vs. the standalone file:
//    onPlayerConnect()  -> vpa_onplayerconnect()
//    onPlayerSpawned()  -> vpa_onplayerspawned()
//    init()             -> inlined in init() above ("--- Vanguard Perk
//                          Animation ---" block: icon-shader precaches and the
//                          connect-loop thread). Upstream's startup iprintln
//                          credit line was dropped (2026-07-30, user request).
//  The standalone file's end_game() helper was dropped: its body was just
//  `level waittill("game_ended");` with nothing after it, i.e. a no-op.
//  Everything else (listener, HUD builder/animation, shader/name/description
//  tables) is verbatim, only reformatted to match this file's style.

//  working on them."
//
//  🌟 THE CAUSE IS ONE `return true` IN STOCK, AND IT IS EXACT.
//  _zm_spawner::check_zombie_damage_callbacks() (:2025-2037) is a SHORT-CIRCUIT
//  loop, not a broadcast:
//
//        for ( i = 0; i < level.zombie_damage_callbacks.size; i++ )
//            if ( self [[ level.zombie_damage_callbacks[i] ]]( ... ) )
//                return true;          <-- every LATER callback is skipped
//
//  and three of the four callbacks in this mod claim their own damage that way:
//
//    | callback                          | registered in            | returns |
//    |-----------------------------------|--------------------------|---------|
//    | deathmachine_damage_response      | this file, init()        | true    |
//    | tesla_zombie_damage_response      | _zm_weap_tesla.gsc:47    | true    |
//    | freezegun_zombie_damage_response  | _zm_weap_freezegun.gsc:23| true    |
//    | do_hitmarker                      | here                     | ALWAYS false |
//
//  So any of those registering ahead of the marker silently deletes the hit
//  feedback for its own weapon - which is exactly the Wunderwaffe and the
//  Winter's Howl, and the Death Machine besides.
//
//  📝 THE THUNDERGUN IS NOT IN THAT TABLE and never was: it registers no damage
//  callback at all. It one-shots (DoDamage self.health + 666,
//  _zm_weap_thundergun.gsc:256), so the zombie is already dead when
//  enemy_death_detection() re-checks isalive() and the HIT path cannot apply to
//  it by construction. Only the KILL marker can, and that runs down a different
//  road with no early-out at all - check_zombie_death_event_callbacks()
//  (:2284-2291) calls every registered function. The probe below reports which
//  of the two actually fires, per weapon, so one game says which without
//  guessing at it.
//
//  🛑 WHY PREPEND RATHER THAN REGISTER. Registration order is load order, and
//  load order is Plutonium's, not this mod's - the three wonder weapons are
//  separate root scripts. Being index 0 is the only position that cannot be
//  taken away. Nothing else is disturbed: the other callbacks keep their
//  relative order, and do_hitmarker returns false unconditionally, so it can
//  never consume an event that belonged to one of them.
//
//  📝 Done on "connected" rather than in init() because every root script's
//  init() has run by the time a player connects - including the ones this has
//  to get ahead of. Once per match; the level flag makes a second player a
//  no-op.

//      maps\mp\zombies\_zm_spawner::zombie_death_event      ->  the death list

//  a hit or kill sound. And BURIED'S GHOST - _zm_ai_ghost.gsc:652 reaches the
//  hit list only for equip_headchopper_zm, and reaches the death list never.
//
//  📝 THE ONES LEFT ALONE ON PURPOSE, because a marker there would be a lie:
//    - the AVOGADRO. avogadro_damage_func returns false for everything that is
//      not melee, so bullets do no damage and the engine issues no notify. A
//      marker would say a hit landed where nothing happened.
//    - LEROY and his crawler ( sloth_damage_func / crawler_damage_func return 0
//      on every branch a player reaches ) and the Who's Who corpse
//      ( _zm_clone.gsc's clone_damage_func sets idamage = 0 ).
//
//  🌟 THE SIGNAL IS THE ENGINE'S OWN "damage" NOTIFY, NOT A DAMAGE CALLBACK.
//  It is issued from finishactordamage AFTER self.actor_damage_func has had its
//  say, so it fires only when damage actually landed, and it carries the amount,
//  the attacker and the means of death. Stock's own enemy_death_detection()
//  waits on exactly this notify - and so does the denizen's own
//  play_screecher_damaged_yelps() ( _zm_ai_screecher.gsc:446 ), which is the
//  proof that a denizen does receive it.
//
//  🌟 ATTACHED FROM THE DAMAGE CHAIN THIS MOD ALREADY OWNS - no new hook.
//  zmqol_actor_damage_wrapper() runs for every actor damage event, before the
//  damage is applied, and a GSC `thread` runs the new thread up to its first
//  waittill before returning - so the watcher is already listening when the
//  notify for THAT SAME hit arrives. One entity field decides it once; every
//  later hit on that entity costs a single isdefined.
//
//  🛑 NO DEATH MACHINE EXEMPTION ON THIS PATH, deliberately. do_hitmarker()
//  steps aside for the minigun because deathmachine_damage_response() owns that
//  weapon's feedback - but that is a zombie DAMAGE CALLBACK, so it never runs
//  for these two enemies either. Exempting them here would leave the Death
//  Machine with no feedback at all on a denizen.
//
//  🛑 Off under `zmqol_minimal 1`, together with the rest of the chain
//  zmqol_better_deadshot_install() installs. That dvar is a diagnostic switch.
// ============================================================================
//  🌟 ARMED AT SPAWN, THE WAY STOCK ARMS ITS OWN. Both AI types are spawned
//  from a named spawner array that stock builds and hangs its own prespawn
//  function on ( _zm_ai_screecher.gsc:33-34, _zm_ai_ghost.gsc:100-105 ), so this
//  hangs one more on the same array through stock's own
//  _zm_utility::add_spawn_function. The watcher is then listening a frame after
//  the enemy exists, long before it can be shot, and nothing about the timing of
//  a damage event has to be assumed.
//
//  Both arrays are plain level variables and add_spawn_function is under
//  maps\mp\zombies, so this stays inside a root script's safe set and simply
//  finds nothing on the maps that have neither.
//
//  📝 zmqol_special_marker_attach() below stays as the net for anything this
//  misses - a spawner built after this ran, or a future AI. The entity latch
//  means whichever gets there first is the only one that arms.

// ============================================================================
//  instant_start  -  skip the dead time between clicking Start and actually
//  being able to play.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Added 2026-07-31, user request. Rewritten same day after the first version
//  (a "race the flags early + watchdog the black screen" hack) was deployed
//  and tested in-game and had NO effect - stock's original onallplayersready()
//  thread was still running in the background driving the real timing, and
//  the hack never actually stopped it.
//
//  The rewrite replaceFunc's maps\mp\zombies\_zm::onallplayersready() directly
//  instead of racing it. Earlier reasoning (see AI_CONTEXT.md-style failure
//  mode: "unqualified same-file call defeats replaceFunc") assumed this
//  couldn't work, because _zm.gsc's own main() calls it unqualified
//  (`level thread onallplayersready();`). That assumption was wrong for this
//  specific call: BO2-Reimagined (H:\Claude\BO2-Reimagined,
//  scripts/zm/_zm_reimagined.gsc:33) successfully does
//  `replaceFunc(maps\mp\zombies\_zm::onallplayersready, scripts\zm\replaced\_zm::onallplayersready);`
//  in a real, working mod - proving replaceFunc DOES redirect this particular
//  call site. Likely explanation: it's a `thread`-ed call, not a synchronous
//  one, and threaded calls resolve through the redirectable function table
//  even when unqualified, unlike plain synchronous same-file calls.
//
//  onallplayersready_instant() below is a copy of the stock body (verified
//  against both the vanilla dump and BO2-Reimagined's copy, which are
//  otherwise identical) with two numbers changed:
//    - the "wait up to 5000ms to learn how many players are expected" timeout
//      cut to 300ms (the value getnumexpectedplayers() waits on doesn't
//      reliably resolve on Plutonium; no reason to burn the full 5s on it)
//    - fade_out_intro_screen_zm's hold/fade shortened from (5.0, 1.5) to
//      (0.15, 0.3) - still a deliberate, brief fade rather than a jarring
//      instant cut, but no longer a multi-second hold
//  Everything else (connected-player sync, solo lives/pistol setup, bot
//  handling, texture-load wait) is kept faithful to stock for correctness.
//  Since this is a real replaceFunc, stock's original body never runs at all
//  - no background thread left to race or fight.
//
//  NOTE: in-game testing (2026-07-31) confirmed this runs correctly and
//  completes fast, but it turned out NOT to be what the user was actually
//  reporting. The multi-second wait they meant happens BEFORE this point
//  entirely - it's a "match starting in..." countdown in Plutonium's private
//  match lobby UI (the Start/Play button), which typing the console command
//  `xpartygo` manually bypasses. That countdown lives in Plutonium's compiled
//  base-game menu system (CoD.Lobby module) - no loose/raw Lua source for it
//  exists anywhere checked (zm_qol's own ui_mp/, the workspace's
//  raw/ui + raw/ui_mp dump, or BO2-Reimagined), so it isn't something this
//  mod can safely patch. Left in anyway since it's a real, if smaller,
//  improvement to the post-load dead time on every game.

//  WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ORIGINS CAPTURE RING, kept because it stays true:
//
//  KNOWN: the generator capture meter intermittently does not draw. It is NOT a
//  hudelem (checkpoint 17 said so and was wrong) and it is NOT a clientfield -
//  it is the OBJECTIVE/waypoint system, zm_tomb_capture_zones.gsc:1506:
//        objective_setprogress( self.n_objective_index, self.n_current_progress / 100 );
//  all of which is stock code this mod does not replace. The capture itself
//  still completes; only the display is missing. Confirmed by the user
//  2026-08-06: "nothing drew at all".
//
//  KNOWN (new, 2026-08-13): the widget is LUI, not engine code. It is
//  TCZWaypoint in ui_mp/t6/zombie/tombcapturezonedisplay.lua, inheriting
//  ObjectiveWaypoint, and it is selected by the objective's NAME string
//  (ZM_TOMB_OBJ_CAPTURE_1 / _2 / RECAPTURE_*). That whole file ships in
//  zm_tomb_patch.ff.
//
//  KNOWN: no commit has ever successfully targeted this. The one that tried
//  (0aa9f46, "free hudelems for the generator ring") aimed at the hudelem pool,
//  which checkpoint 18 established the ring does not use. So "it worked last
//  release and broke this release" is not a regression - it is the same
//  unfixed intermittent race landing differently on different boots.
//
//  🛑 FALSIFIED 2026-08-13 - THE HOLD IS NOT THE CAUSE, AND IS NOW REVERTED.
//
//  It shipped as a deliberately falsifiable test, and the evidence killed it.
//  console_zm.log holds BOTH of the user's Origins games back to back:
//        line 4694  [zm_qol] intro: held 1.6s ...   -> ring did NOT draw
//        line 8800  [zm_qol] intro: held 1.6s ...   -> ring DID draw
//  Identical hold, identical build, opposite outcomes. A constant cannot
//  explain a variable, so the startup-race theory is dead and the 1.55s of
//  extra black screen on Origins was buying nothing. Back to 0.05 everywhere.
//
//  What the same A/B DOES show, kept here so it is not lost: the one logged
//  difference between the two boots was
//        game A  solo status: expected=1 connected=0   -> no ring
//        game B  solo status: expected=1 connected=1   -> ring
//  i.e. the player was already connected at map-init time in the good boot and
//  not in the bad one. That is a lead about connect ORDER, not about this wait,
//  and it is not enough to act on. The repaired probe in zm_tomb\zm_tomb.gsc
//  (the old one could never print - see its header) is what settles it.

//
//  🛑 NO ZOMBIES ON ANY BURIED LOCATION. Confirmed in game 2026-08-02: Borough
//  and Maze both spawn none. This is NOT the Maze zone bug - the A/B run proved
//  that, because Borough never had the zone seal applied (it was gated to
//  location "maze") and fails identically:
//        SPAWNPROBE street t=20 spawners=0 multi=0 groups=0 pool=15 total=6 alive=0 limit=24 flag=1
//        SPAWNPROBE maze   t=20 spawners=0 multi=0 groups=0 pool=3  total=6 alive=0 limit=24 flag=1
//
//  Every gate in _zm.gsc::round_spawning() reads healthy - the spawn pool is
//  populated, "spawn_zombies" is set, zombie_ai_limit is 24, 6 zombies are queued
//  and none are alive. And there is NO script error anywhere in the log.
//
//  That silence is the clue. The spawn block is
//        if ( isdefined( level.zombie_spawners ) )          // _zm.gsc:3037
//        {
//            ...
//            spawner = random( level.zombie_spawners );     // _zm.gsc:3059
//            ai = spawn_zombie( spawner, spawner.targetname, spawn_point );
//        }
//  An EMPTY array is still isdefined, so it would enter, random() would yield
//  undefined, and spawner.targetname would throw a script error every attempt.
//  We see no errors - so the array is more likely UNDEFINED, which skips the whole
//  block silently and leaves ai undefined. That is a perfect match for the symptom.
//
//  🛑 The previous probe could not tell those two apart: it did
//  `if (isdefined(x)) n = x.size;` and printed 0 for both. Same measurement flaw as
//  the zbarrier and MAZEZONE probes - a bare count with no way to read it. So this
//  one reports def and size SEPARATELY.
//
//  Root script on purpose: it has to run on a map that WORKS, to establish what a

//
//  `zmqol_minimal 1` at the console, before starting a map, stops EVERY
//  periodic thread this mod owns from running: the HUD watcher, the round
//  counter master, the LOD fix, night mode, the co-op pause watcher, the game
//  and round timers, the zombie counter, the round chalk, the velocity meter
//  and its poll, the Death Machine state monitor, the credits banner, the
//  console-command watcher and all five dvar watchers.
//
//  🛑 IT IS A DIAGNOSTIC, NOT A FEATURE. Default 0; nothing changes unless it
//  is typed. Everything one-shot - weapon registration, the Wunderfizz, the
//  wall-buy retag, perks, the wonder weapons - is deliberately still active.
//
//  WHY IT EXISTS. Origins dies with EXE_ERR_RELIABLE_CYCLED_OUT at ~20-35s and
//  three explanations have now been wrong: the night-mode ramp (v1.93.1), the
//  capture-objective re-declare and HUD nudge (v1.94.0, and the crash came back
//  with both provably off - neither line appears in the crash log), and this
//  session's zone-HUD settext (the crashing session's own dvar dump reads
//  hud_zone "0", so that loop was not even running).
//
//  🌟 The same dump settles a great deal more, and it is why a switch is worth
//  shipping rather than another guess: in the crashing session hud_master "0",
//  every hud_* sub-option "0", hitmarkers "0", round_summary "0", lod_fix "0".
//  Almost the entire HUD was already off and it crashed anyway. What was left
//  on was night_mode "1" and velocity "1".
//
//  So one boot with this set to 1 splits the remaining space in half:
//    - Origins survives  -> the emitter IS one of this mod's periodic threads,
//                           and the list above is now the whole suspect pool.
//    - Origins still dies -> every periodic thread is exonerated and the cause
//                           is in one-shot map setup, or is not this mod.
//  Either answer is worth more than another fix built on the likeliest story.

//  zmqol_whoswho_knife  -  Who's Who hands you a PACK-A-PUNCHED BALLISTIC KNIFE
//
//  User, 2026-08-17: "make it so when you get downed with Who's Who you have a
//  pack a punched ballistic knife instead of the stock m1911 like the perk
//  normally does, this way the perk isn't complete trash because the pap'd
//  ballistic knife in bo2 zombies acts as an instant revive if you shoot a
//  downed player with its projectile, again only pap'd... Make this a toggable
//  on/off option in the in-game/pause menu settings under the GAME tab."
//
//  🌟 THE REVIVE HALF NEEDS NO CODE - TREYARCH ALREADY WROTE IT, FOR THIS EXACT
//  ENTITY. maps\mp\zombies\_zm_clone::clone_damage_func(), which is the damage
//  callback spawn_player_clone() puts on every player clone (:60), reads:
//
//      if ( sweapon == "knife_ballistic_upgraded_zm" ||
//           sweapon == "knife_ballistic_bowie_upgraded_zm" ||
//           sweapon == "knife_ballistic_no_melee_upgraded_zm" ||
//           sweapon == "knife_ballistic_sickle_upgraded_zm" )
//          self notify( "player_revived", eattacker );
//
//  and _zm_chugabud::chugabud_spawn_corpse() (:196) builds the Who's Who corpse
//  with that very function. So shooting your own body with an upgraded ballistic
//  knife has ALWAYS been wired to revive you - the perk simply never gives you a
//  gun that can do it. This change hands over the missing weapon and nothing
//  else; the four weapon names above are the whole contract and they are read
//  out of stock, not typed from memory.
//
//  🛑 WHAT IT REPLACES, exactly. _zm_chugabud::chugabud_fake_revive() opens with
//  `self notify( "fake_revive" )` (:392) and later calls
//  `self give_start_weapon( 1 )` (:427), which is
//      giveweapon( level.start_weapon ); givestartammo( ... ); switchtoweapon( ... )
//  (_zm_utility.gsc). level.start_weapon is m1911_zm on the classic maps and
//  c96_zm on Origins - which is why this takes level.start_weapon rather than
//  naming a gun.
//
//  🛑 IT POLLS FOR THE PISTOL INSTEAD OF WAITING A FIXED FRAME. The notify is at
//  the top of that function and the giveweapon is 35 lines below it, with a
//  spawn-point search in between; betting on "one frame later" is betting on
//  that search never yielding. Waiting for the weapon to actually be in the
//  player's hands cannot lose that race, and if the pistol never arrives nothing
//  is taken away and the perk behaves exactly as stock.
//
//  🛑 ORIGINS CANNOT HAVE THIS AND IT IS NOT A SCRIPTING PROBLEM. `Unlinker
//  --list` over the retail zone\all\zm_tomb.ff and zm_prison.ff finds NO
//  knife_ballistic asset of any kind - no weapon, no fx, no reticle - while
//  zm_transit.ff carries all six variants. Stock zm_tomb.gsc and zm_prison.gsc
//  likewise contain zero include_weapon( "knife_ballistic..." ) lines. The gun
//  does not exist on those two maps, so it cannot be given there; the guard
//  below is the real precondition (include_weapon() is what calls precacheitem,
//  _zm_weapons.gsc:700-701) rather than a hard-coded map list that could go
//  stale. Mob of the Dead does not have Who's Who at all, so the gap is Origins
//  only - stated plainly rather than shipped quietly.

//  BOOT. Firing crossbow_upgraded_zm produces TWO entities: the missile handed
//  to the "missile_fire" notify, and a separate grenade-classname entity - its
//  grenadeWeapon, crossbow_explosive_bolt_upgraded_zm (weaponType grenade,
//  fuseTime 3, stickiness "Stick to all"), which is what sticks and explodes.
//  The POI has to go on the GRENADE, or zombies walk to the wrong place. Both
//  the split and the "missile_fire" notify name are BO2-Reimagined's, out of
//  scripts\zm\reimagined\_zm_weap_crossbow.gsc, which solves this same problem
//  on the same engine - the designated reference for this project.
//
//  Told apart by model, which the two weapon files settle outright:
//        crossbow_upgraded_zm            projectileModel t5_weapon_crossbow_bolt_exp
//        crossbow_explosive_bolt_*_zm    projectileModel t5_weapon_crossbow_bolt
//  so the search below cannot pick up the missile it was launched from.
//
//  📝 THREE DELIBERATE DIFFERENCES FROM REIMAGINED'S VERSION, all of them
//  narrowing it back to what was actually asked for:
//    1. Their version also plays a zm_electric_stun animation on the zombie the
//       bolt lands in. That is a Reimagined balance change, not BO1 behaviour,
//       and the request was the distraction "same as bo1". Dropped.
//    2. Theirs deletes the missile entity. This mod's crossbow already works
//       without that and the user has played it; deleting an entity the mod has
//       never deleted is a behaviour change outside the request. Left alone.
//    3. Theirs takes the first unmarked bolt in the array; this takes the
//       CLOSEST unmarked bolt to where the shot actually landed, so a bolt still
//       in flight from an earlier shot - or from the un-upgraded crossbow, which
//       this function does not mark at all - cannot be picked up by mistake.

//  BETTER DEADSHOT  -  v1.99.73, user request 2026-08-19
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  *"add an option in the game tab in settings as an option to make deadshot do
//  double headshot damage, same as reimagined. Just a simple on/off switch"*
//
//  🛑 WHY DEADSHOT NEEDED THIS AT ALL. Deadshot Daiquiri's entire stock effect is
//  ONE client-side engine call - `self usealternateaimparams()`, made by
//  _zm.csc:611 on the deadshot_perk clientfield - which swaps the aim-assist
//  lock-on to a parameter set that favours the head. Aim assist exists only on a
//  controller, so on mouse and keyboard the perk does *nothing whatsoever*. That
//  is stock, not a fault in this mod, and it is the reason the perk has the
//  reputation it does.
//
//  🌟 THE HOOK: RE-POINT level.callbackactordamage, DO NOT replaceFunc.
//  Stock installs its own wrapper as a POINTER (`level.callbackactordamage =
//  ::actor_damage_override_wrapper`, _zm.gsc:976), and CLAUDE.md §4 failure mode
//  3 is exactly this shape: a `::fn` captured at assignment cannot be relied on
//  to follow a later replaceFunc. Re-pointing is the prescribed route.
//
//  🛑 AND ORIGINS RE-POINTS IT TOO. zm_tomb.gsc:219 installs
//  tomb_actor_damage_override_wrapper, which adds the Zombie-Blood damage gate,
//  the capture-zombie points and the tank/gib death handling before calling
//  stock's wrapper qualified. So this must CHAIN to whatever is already
//  installed rather than assume stock's - that is what level.zmqol_prev_actordamage
//  is for. Nothing is reimplemented and no map's own damage rules are lost.
//
//  🌟 IT SCALES THE INCOMING DAMAGE, NOT THE FINAL DAMAGE. BO2-Reimagined does
//  `final_damage *= 2` inside its own copy of actor_damage_override; this mod
//  does not own that function, and reproducing it would mean re-implementing
//  Origins' wrapper as well. Pre-scaling lets the entire existing chain run
//  untouched. 📝 The one behavioural difference, stated rather than hidden: an
//  enemy whose `self.actor_damage_func` returns a FIXED number regardless of
//  input - Brutus-style armour rules - is unaffected here where Reimagined would
//  double it. That is arguably the more correct outcome, but it IS a difference.
//
//  The eligibility test is Reimagined's, as asked: bullet headshots only,
//  shotguns excluded except the KSG, metalstorm excluded.
//
//  🛑 INSTALLED AFTER initial_blackscreen_passed. Stock sets the pointer during
//  map init and Origins re-points it there too; installing any earlier would
//  either be overwritten or would capture the wrong predecessor. No zombie can
//  be damaged before that flag, so nothing is missed.

//  🌟 NO NEW HOOK AND NO NEW RISK. It rides the level.callbackactordamage chain
//  zmqol_better_deadshot_install() already owns - the same chain, the same
//  single install, the same chaining to whatever Origins or a gametype put
//  there first. Nothing else about the damage path changes.
//
//  🛑 IT RAISES THE DAMAGE TO EXACTLY self.health, NOT TO A BIG NUMBER.
//  Zombie health is grown 10% a round and stock's own ai_calculate_health()
//  (_zm.gsc:3572) only stops when the value OVERFLOWS a 32-bit int - which is
//  the whole basis of the INSTAKILL ROUNDS row on the PATCHES tab. So at a high
//  round self.health can sit near 2^31, and any fixed constant is either too
//  small to kill there or large enough to overflow when a boss damage func
//  multiplies it. self.health is the exact amount needed and can never do
//  either.
//
//  🛑 BOSSES KEEP THEIR OWN RULES, and that is deliberate rather than a gap.
//  Stock runs self.actor_damage_func BEFORE the final damage is applied
//  (_zm.gsc:4435), and that is where the Panzer's faceplate, Brutus's helmet,
//  the Ghost's phase state and the Avogadro's EMP-only immunity live. A func
//  that SCALES damage still receives self.health here and still kills; a func
//  that returns 0 for the wrong weapon - the Avogadro's - correctly keeps its
//  immunity. Forcing those open would not be a cheat, it would be deleting the
//  boss fights.

//  function is called for every point of player damage and must RETURN the
//  (possibly modified) damage, unlike callbackplayerdamage/callbackactordamage
//  which are void.
//
//  🛑 CHAINED, NOT CLOBBERED. `level.overrideplayerdamage` is not free ground -
//  the CLEANSED gametype sets it (Buried/Diner: maps\mp\gametypes_zm\
//  zcleansed.gsc:100, `level.overrideplayerdamage = ::cleanseddamagechecks`).
//  Overwriting it outright would silently break that gametype's own damage
//  rules for anyone who selects it. level.zmqol_prev_overrideplayerdamage
//  captures whatever is already installed - stock's nothing-at-all in the
//  ordinary case, or Cleansed's function - and this wrapper calls through to
//  it FIRST, then applies the 3-hit cap to whatever damage value comes back.
//
//  🛑 INSTALLED AFTER initial_blackscreen_passed, same reasoning as
//  zmqol_better_deadshot_install() directly above: stock/gametype init runs
//  during map load, before any zombie can deal damage, so installing after
//  that flag guarantees this sees whatever the map's own init already set
//  rather than racing it.
//
//  🌟 THE CAP, NOT A FULL REIMPLEMENTATION OF BO3+'S HEALTH MODEL. BO2 has no
//  "hits to down" counter to hook - health is a plain number and downing is
//  whatever reduces self.health to 0 (self.maxhealth in _zm.gsc:1063-1065's own
//  magic_bullet_shield code, confirmed the real field name). Capping a single
//  hit's damage at self.maxhealth / 3 makes it IMPOSSIBLE for fewer than 3 hits
//  to empty a full health bar, on every round, regardless of how far zombie
//  melee damage has scaled - which is the BO3+ behaviour being asked for: you
//  are never one- or two-shot by a claw at a high round the way BO2 stock will
//  do to you. Natural regen between hits can only make it take MORE than 3,
//  never fewer.
//
//  🛑 SCOPED TO ZOMBIE MELEE ONLY. This paragraph used to say the string was the
//  lowercase "melee" from _zm.gsc:587 and that "MOD_MELEE" was unrelated. THAT
//  WAS BACKWARDS and it is why the feature never worked - see the corrected note
//  over zmqol_three_hit_down_scale(). The real swipe is MOD_MELEE
//  (_zm_spawner.gsc:895); _zm.gsc:587 is the turret-miss path. Explosives, fire,

//  🛑 v2.7.3 - THIS FUNCTION NEVER FIRED ONCE. Two independent defects, both
//  measured against the stock dump rather than reasoned about:
//
//  1. THE MEANS-OF-DEATH STRING WAS WRONG. The banner above claimed real zombie
//     melee arrives as the lowercase literal "melee", citing _zm.gsc:587. That
//     line is `zombiemode_melee_miss()`, which only runs
//     `if ( isdefined( self.enemy.curr_pay_turret ) )` - the player-on-a-turret
//     MISS case. It is not the normal swipe at all.
//
//     Real zombie melee damage is dealt in _zm_spawner.gsc:895:
//         self.player_targets[i] dodamage( self.meleedamage, self.origin,
//                                          self, self, "none", "MOD_MELEE" );
//     (self.meleedamage = 60, _zm_spawner.gsc:257). _zm_ai_faller.gsc:495 and
//     _zm_ffotd.gsc:205 use "MOD_MELEE" too. So `smeansofdeath != "melee"`
//     rejected every genuine zombie hit and the cap was never applied - which is
//     exactly the report: 3 HIT DOWN on, still downed in 2 hits on Diner.
//
//  2. THE CAP WAS OFF BY ONE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN FOUR HITS, NOT THREE.
//     int( 100 / 3 ) = 33, and 3 x 33 = 99 < 100 - so a full-health player
//     survived the third hit and went down on the fourth. To down on exactly the
//     third hit the cap must be the CEILING: 2d < maxhealth <= 3d. ceil(100/3)
//     = 34 gives 68 < 100 <= 102. Integer ceiling here is ( n + 2 ) / 3.
//
//  Now gated on the attacker being a zombie, which is the actual semantic the
//  request asks for ("3 zombie hits"), with the means-of-death test kept as a
//  narrowing filter so player explosives, fire, fall damage and traps stay
//  untouched. Both melee strings are accepted so the turret-miss path is covered
//  too.
//
//  📝 WHAT THIS DOES TO JUGGERNOG - checked, not left to chance. Jugg is 160 in
//  BO2, not BO1's 250 (_zm_perks.gsc:69, zombie_perk_juggernaut_health). Stock
//  zombie melee of 60 already downs a Jugg player in 3 (60/120/180). ceil(160/3)
//  = 54 binds slightly below 60 and keeps it at exactly 3, so the perk's feel is

//  enableaimassist() / disableaimassist() are per-ENTITY calls that mark whether

//  zombie it spawns ( _zm_utility.gsc:258 ) and disableaimassist() on the Ghost,
//  the Sloth and Origins' quadrotor. Turning that off for every zombie removes
//  aim assist in the only place it exists - which is a genuine switch, and it is
//  independent of the player's TARGET ASSIST row.
//
//  📝 DEADSHOT IS NOT FIXED BY THIS, AND WAS NEVER GOING TO BE. Its head snap is
//  usealternateaimparams(), which re-tunes assist rather than creating it. The
//  BETTER DEADSHOT toggle ( v1.99.73 ) is what makes the perk worth buying with
//  assist off and on mouse and keyboard.
//
//  Default 1 = stock. A new switch must not change what the mod already does.

//
//  User, 2026-08-20: *"I grabbed the B23R wallbuy ... then when I spun the box
//  and got the B23R version from the box which I'm pretty certain is the B23R
//  extended mag ... just make it so the B23R and also [any] wall buy weapon that
//  has a mystery box version that has a attachment, make it so that the wall buy
//  version also has the same attachment as the box version (Again same as you
//  did previously in the mods' development for the MP40) ... fixing that for all
//  gun wallbuys with box attachment variants would fix the issue of being able
//  to have the same weapon twice."*
//
//  -- WHY THE MOD CAUSED THIS, MEASURED FROM THE STOCK DUMP -------------------
//  In stock BO2 exactly ONE map has attachment variants in its box: Origins,
//  with ak74u_extclip_zm, beretta93r_extclip_zm and mp40_stalker_zm (a grep of
//  every map's include_weapon calls - the other five maps have none at all).
//  This mod puts the first two into the box on EVERY map:
//      zm_transit.gsc:592,598  zm_nuked.gsc:698,703  zm_highrise.gsc:530,535
//      zm_buried.gsc:159,164   zm_prison.gsc:351,355
//  while the wall buy still hands out the plain def - so the box copy and the
//  wall-buy copy are two different weapons and both fit in the inventory. That
//  is the duplicate B23R the user ended up holding on Nuketown, and it is the
//  same shape as the Origins MP40 the user had fixed on 2026-08-07.
//
//  -- THE MECHANISM IS ORIGINS' OWN, GENERALISED ------------------------------
//  zm_tomb.gsc's zmqol_tomb_mp40_stalker_wallbuys() is the proven version of
//  this and every hard-won detail in it is carried over:
//    - retag the unitrigger STUB's .zombie_weapon_upgrade / .weapon_upgrade,
//      because _zm_weapons.gsc:1120 reads the weapon off the stub live at
//      purchase, so this does not have to race init_spawnable_weapon_upgrade();
//    - push the same value onto any ALREADY-LIVE trigger, because
//      copy_zombie_keys_onto_trigger (_zm_unitrigger.gsc:624-629) copies it once
//      at build time and a built trigger is never rebuilt, so a stub-only fix
//      leaves an existing wall buy handing out the old gun;
//    - refresh hint_string and cost from the replacement's own registration, and
//      REFUSE to touch anything if that weapon is not in level.zombie_weapons -
//      get_weapon_hint/cost index it directly, and writing an undefined hint is
//      what killed the buy prompt outright in v1.59.2;
//    - re-scan for the whole match instead of once, because the one-shot version
//      lost a race it could not see (v1.80.0) and gave the plain gun for the
//      rest of the game.
//
//  ORIGINS' OWN MP40 THREAD IS DELIBERATELY LEFT RUNNING. It is confirmed
//  working in game and this pass writes the identical value, so the overlap is a
//  no-op rather than a conflict. Nothing is removed from a working feature to
//  make a new one tidier.
//
//  THE PAIRS ARE ONLY EVER BASE -> VARIANT OF THE SAME GUN, so ammo, hint and
//  cost all already match: the mod's per-map scripts register each variant with
//  the same hint and cost as the base and call add_shared_ammo_weapon() on it.
//  A map that has neither the wall buy nor the variant simply matches nothing.

//  zmqol_ai_calculate_health  -  INSTAKILL ROUNDS
//
//  replaceFunc'd in main(). OFF is byte-exact stock; ON is legacy's version.
//  The two differ in KIND, not degree, and this is the measured difference:
//
//    stock ( _zm.gsc:3572 ) SATURATES. From round 10 it grows the health by
//    +10% a round, and the moment that addition wraps past 2^31 it restores
//    old_health and RETURNS - so from round 163 on every round carries the same
//    enormous health and zombies never get easier.
//
//    legacy has no saturation check at all, so the wrap is allowed to happen and
//    lands NEGATIVE; it then resets a negative result to zombie_health_start
//    ( 150 ) and clamps anything above ai_zombie_health( 155 ) down to that.
//    Simulated over the stock numbers ( start 150, +100 a round to 9, +10% from
//    10 - _zm.gsc:860-862 ):
//
//        round 155   1,044,606,723   <- the cap
//        round 156-162   clamped to that same figure
//        round 163   the addition wraps to -2,055,760,018, which is < 0, so the
//                    health resets to 150 and one bullet kills again
//
//  That is the round-163 "instakill rounds" the row is named for, and it is why
//  the ON branch has to SKIP the saturation check rather than add a clamp on top
//  of it: with stock's early return in place the wrap can never happen at all.
//
//  🛑 ai_zombie_health() lives in _zm.gsc, so it is called qualified - this is a

//  zmqol_patches_watch  -  DOUBLE TAP 1.0 and NO BARRIER ATTACKS, live
//
//  Both are applied ON CHANGE ONLY and both are reversible, because the OFF
//  position has to be the value the game shipped with rather than a number this
//  file invented. The stock value of each is CACHED ONCE, before anything is
//  written, and restored verbatim.
//
//  🌟 DOUBLE TAP 1.0 = perk_weapRateEnhanced 0, verified twice over: the boot
//  dvar dump in console_zm.log carries `perk_weapRateEnhanced "1"` (so the dvar
//  is real on this build and 1 is its stock value), and BO2-Reimagined - the
//  designated reference - sets exactly this dvar to 0 and documents the result
//  in its own README under Double Tap: *"Removed shooting 2 bullets for every
//  shot"*. Double Tap 2.0's extra damage IS that second bullet, so with it off
//  the perk is the 1.0 version: fire rate only.
//
//  🌟 NO BARRIER ATTACKS NEEDS NO replaceFunc, and that is not a shortcut - it
//  is the smaller change. The legacy mod replaces
//  _zm_spawner::should_attack_player_thru_boards with `return false`, but
//  level.attack_player_thru_boards_range is read in exactly two places in the

//  🛑 IT IS NOT AN ACTION ROW, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REQUEST. CHANGE ROUND and
//  KILL HORDE write themselves back to 0 as soon as they fire; this one HOLDS
//  its value, because 0 ("NONE") is a real setting and the user wants to step
//  back DOWN the list to take points away. So it is applied on CHANGE only, and
//  the last applied value is seeded from the dvar on the first pass - otherwise
//  every spawn would re-apply whatever the row happens to be sitting on.
//
//  🛑 THE SCORE IS WRITTEN DIRECTLY, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. The obvious route
//  is _zm_score::add_to_player_score / minus_to_player_score, but
//  minus_to_player_score ends with `level notify( "spent_points", self, points )`
//  ( _zm_score.gsc:341 ) and Origins listens to it: zm_tomb_challenges.gsc:49
//  counts every point "spent" towards the Rituals of the Ancients points
//  challenge, whose reward is a free Double Tap. Stepping this row from 1000000
//  down to 1000 would hand that challenge over instantly. Stock itself assigns
//  the field directly in exactly this situation - player_downed_score_loss does
//  `self.score = points;` at _zm_score.gsc:303-308 - so this is stock's own
//  route, not a way around one.
//
//  📝 score_total is raised by the same delta when the row goes UP, which is
//  what add_to_player_score would have done ( :322-323 ); it is deliberately not
//  lowered again, because stock's minus path never touches it either.
//
//  📝 In co-op this reads one server dvar, so it sets everyone's points - the

//
//  🌟 THE DESTINATIONS ARE THE STRAT TESTER'S OWN, copied value for value out of
//  H:\Claude\Strat-Tester-BO2\scripts\zm\strattester\commands.gsc::tpcase() -
//  position AND angles, so each one lands facing the way it does there. Nothing
//  is invented: Nuketown has no list in that file, so until v2.10.4 it had no
//  row in the menu and no case here.
//
//  v2.10.4 - NUKETOWN, measured from the map's OWN entities, not authored by
//  hand. zm_nuked.ff's mapents carry exactly three `player_respawn_point`
//  structs - the spots stock's own zone manager puts a respawning player on
//  (_zm_zonemgr.gsc:661/832 pick the nearest one in an enabled zone) - so
//  they are, by construction, places a player can stand:
//      culdesac_zone            (-56.5, -228.5, 6)  yaw 270   SPAWN
//      openhouse1_backyard_zone (-1872, 402, -24)   yaw 340   GREEN HOUSE BACKYARD
//      openhouse2_backyard_zone (1944, 384, -24)    yaw 190   YELLOW HOUSE BACKYARD
//  openhouse1 = green and openhouse2 = yellow is read off zm_nuked.gsc:588-596
//  (nuked_update_player_zones counts openhouse1_backyard_zone into
//  level.green_backyard and openhouse2 into level.yellow_backyard). The
//  angles are the structs' own. Nothing else on that map is a measured
//  standing position (the other structs are the box/perk pads, which put a
//  player inside a machine), so three is the honest list - add more only
//  from a `.where` reading.
//
//  🛑 THE INDEX ORDER MUST MATCH THE LUI LIST EXACTLY. The menu row's values are
//  indices into the switch below, and the two lists are written to be read side
//  by side - ui\t6\menus\optionssettings.lua, CreateQolCheatsTab, ZmTele. The
//  TranZit order in particular is NOT the Strat Tester's own order.
//
//  🛑 CLASSIC ONLY, AND THIS IS THE TRAP THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BITTEN. These
//  are classic-layout coordinates; in a survival or grief game the same map is a
//  small carved-out arena and every one of them is outside it. The test is
//  ui_gametype == "zclassic" and NOT `ui_zm_mapstartlocation != "transit"`,
//  because Bus Depot is zstandard AT location transit - the exact false negative
//  that cost this mod a perk on every TranZit survival in v1.83.0 ( see the long
//  note over the Vulture gate ). ui_gametype is safe to read here for the same
//  reason it is safe there.
//
//  📝 v2.10.4 - NUKETOWN IS THE ONE EXCEPTION TO THE CLASSIC GATE. That map
//  registers only zstandard (zm_nuked.gsc:629 - there is no zclassic there),
//  and its zstandard IS the whole map, not a carved-out arena, so the
//  survival-arena reasoning above does not apply. zmqol_teleport_watch() lets
//  zm_nuked through on any gametype; every other map keeps the classic gate.
//
//  🛑 v2.4.2 - SPLIT INTO A SELECTOR + A SEPARATE EXECUTE ROW, MATCHING THE
//  STRAT TESTER'S OWN UX. User, 2026-08-26: *"right now you just cycle through
//  the teleport locations... and then it automatically tp's you to the
//  location when you exit the pause menu... there should be an option to
//  execute teleport... underneath, same as the strat tester."* Checked against
//  the Strat Tester's own menu (optionsstrattester.lua:240-293): it has a
//  left-right destination selector PLUS a separate "EXECUTE TELEPORT" button -
//  picking a destination there only ever writes a dvar, never moves the
//  player by itself.
//
//  "teleport" is now a HOLDING selector, same shape as set_points (0 is a
//  real choice - OFF/no destination picked - and picking a destination does
//  not by itself do anything). "execute_teleport" is the new ACTION row: it
//  writes itself back to 0 the instant it fires, same shape as kill_horde /
//  end_round, so the CHEATS row snaps back to DISABLED and the button can be
//  pressed again for the same destination without having to reselect it.

//  zmqol_hud_round_anchor  -  ROUND COUNTER LEFT                     (v2.0.8)
//
//  User, 2026-08-21: *"my mod has the round counter at the top right of the
//  screen like cold war zombies ... it'd be cool to have an option in the hud
//  tab ... to be able to have it on the top left (same vertical y coords, just
//  on the top left instead of top right, same as bo4 zombies)."*
//
//  🌟 THE MIRROR IS DERIVED FROM TWO SHIPPED ELEMENTS, NOT GUESSED. T6 hudelem
//  x is measured from the SAFE-AREA edge named by horzalign, and it grows
//  OUTWARD from that edge into the margin. Both directions are already in this
//  file with working values:
//        round_hud()   horzalign "right", x = +25   (top right, 25 into the margin)
//        healthbar     horzalign "left",  x = -45   (bottom left, 45 into the margin)
//  So the exact mirror of the round counter's +25 on the right is -25 on the
//  left, and it lands the same distance in from the screen edge.
//
//  🛑 THE WHOLE STACK MOVES, NOT JUST THE NUMBER. timer() and
//  qol_options.gsc::qol_opt_round_timer_hud() are calibrated to sit directly
//  under the round counter and both carried its x = 25 verbatim - the comment
//  above timer() says so and warns that changing one without the other splits
//  the stack. All three now read this one anchor. Only the SIDE changes; every
//  y is untouched, which is exactly what the user asked for.
//
//  📝 Twin of qol_options.gsc::zmqol_hud_round_anchor(). Same shape as

//  randomly die" the user is describing, and it is also what quietly removes a
//  zombie stuck on scenery instead of making the player go and find it.
//
//  🛑 THE BELOW-WORLD KILL IS DELIBERATELY KEPT, AND IT IS NOT A COMPROMISE.
//  The same loop also kills a zombie that has fallen below
//  level.zombie_vars["below_world_check"]. A zombie under the map cannot be
//  shot, so removing that kill would not "make the player earn it" - it would
//  end the round FOREVER. Keeping it is what makes this patch safe to leave on.
//
//  🛑 AND SO IS zombie_assure_node(), which is a different function
//  (_zm_spawner.gsc:600) and is NOT touched: it fires only when a zombie failed
//  to find ANY usable entrance node, waits 20 seconds and then kills it. That
//  zombie has no path to anywhere, so it is the same unkillable case as the one
//  above. Everything the player could actually walk up to and shoot survives.
//
//  Default 0 = stock, like every other PATCHES row. The dvar is read on every
//  pass rather than captured, so the row takes effect mid-match.
//
//  📝 The body below is stock's, verbatim, plus the added branches marked in it.
//  The two /# #/ developer blocks stock has inside the kill branches are dropped
//  because they are empty in the retail dump.
//
//  🛑 v2.14.5 - AND THE PATCH DID NOTHING ON TWO MAPS, WHICH IS WHY THE
//  IGNORE FLAG IS SET BELOW. The user, playing Origins on 2026-09-06 with the row
//  ON: *"a zombie just bled out on its own from me getting far away from it,
//  causing the round to end due to it being the last zombie"*. The live log had
//  `no_bleedout "1"` and NOT ONE `SUPPRESSED` line, so a third route was killing
//  it. It is `level._zombies_round_spawn_failsafe`, a per-map POINTER:
//
//      _zm.gsc:88-89        set to _zm::round_spawn_failsafe only
//                           `if ( !isdefined( ... ) )` - so this mod's own
//                           assignment in main() survives on four maps
//      zm_tomb.gsc:164      OVERWRITES it with ::tomb_round_spawn_failsafe
//      zm_prison.gsc:99     OVERWRITES it with ::alcatraz_round_spawn_failsafe
//
//  Both assignments run inside the map's own main(), AFTER this mod's main() and
//  BEFORE `_zm::init()` reaches `_zm_gametype::custom_spawn_init_func`, which is
//  what array_threads the pointer onto every spawner. There is no hook point in
//  that window, so re-pointing cannot win the race.
//
//  🌟 So every zombie on Origins and Mob of the Dead runs TWO failsafes: this
//  patched one (threaded directly by _zm::round_spawning:3068) and the map's own
//  UNPATCHED copy from the spawn function. The map's kills at 15 seconds, half
//  this one's 30, which is why it always won.
//
//  The fix is stock's own escape hatch - see zmqol_nb_sync_ignore_flag() above -
//  and the ordering is not a hope: run_spawn_functions() opens with
//  `waittillframeend` (_zm_utility.gsc:284), so the map's copy cannot start until
//  the end of the frame in which this one already set the flag. Its very first
//  check then returns.
//
//  🛑 The map copies are ALSO replaced, in scripts\zm\zm_tomb\zm_tomb.gsc and
//  scripts\zm\zm_prison\zm_prison.gsc, for the zombies that never go through
//  round_spawning() (Origins' capture-zone spawns, Grief's zmeat spawns). Whether
//  a replaceFunc reaches a call made through a stored pointer is NOT established
//  on this project - STOCK_REFERENCE 7a records the opposite - so those two
//  replacements print once when they run. The flag above is the belt; they are
//  the braces.
// ============================================================================
//  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  zmqol_nb_sync_ignore_flag  -  v2.14.5
//
//  🌟 `self.ignore_round_spawn_failsafe` IS STOCK'S OWN ESCAPE HATCH AND NOTHING
//  IN STOCK EVER SETS IT. Four occurrences in the whole 2,093-file dump, all of
//  them the same `isdefined(...) && ...` read at the top of a failsafe loop:
//  _zm.gsc (shared), zm_tomb.gsc (Origins), zm_prison.gsc (Mob of the Dead) and
//  the Diner copy. Treyarch left the writer to mods. So writing it cannot
//  collide with anything, and it switches off EVERY variant at once - including
//  the two this mod does not otherwise reach.
//
//  Ownership is tracked separately (`zmqol_nb_owns_ignore`) so this copy can
//  tell its own flag from one another script set, and so turning the row off
//  mid-match puts the zombie back exactly where stock had it.
//  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  zmqol_nb_watch_death_once / zmqol_nb_death_watch  -  ATTRIBUTION   (v2.14.6)
//
//  Second report, 2026-09-06, Origins round 2 with the row ON: the last zombie
//  was knifed once at a barrier, the player ran to generator 2, and it died on
//  its own. This time the log PROVED both hooks were live -
//      [zm_qol] no_bleedout: shared failsafe hook LIVE on zm_tomb - row=1
//      [zm_qol] no_bleedout: Origins 15s failsafe REPLACEMENT is live - row=1
//  - and printed no SUPPRESSED and no BELOW-WORLD line. So the kill came from
//  neither timer, and guessing which of Origins' other killers it was would be
//  exactly the thing this project does not do.
//
//  🌟 IT ALSO SETTLED AN OPEN QUESTION. The "REPLACEMENT is live" line is proof
//  that a Plutonium replaceFunc DOES reach a call made through a stored function
//  pointer, at least when the pointer is captured after the replace:
//  level._zombies_round_spawn_failsafe holds ::tomb_round_spawn_failsafe and the
//  mod's copy is what ran. STOCK_REFERENCE 7a modes 2-3 are narrower than they
//  read.
//
//  So this watcher names the killer instead. One line per zombie that dies with
//  no player attacker while the row is on - what killed it, the means of death,
//  the weapon, and whether the giant robot's foot had marked it.

// ============================================================================
//  NO BLEEDOUT, PART 2  -  THE SPAWN-TIME KILL              (v2.9.15)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User, 2026-08-31: *"The 'No Bleedout' patch failed during testing (the last
//  zombie on Round 13 despawned/died on its own after ~1 minute of
//  distance/time). Fix the logic so that when 'No Bleedout' is enabled, zombies
//  (especially the final zombie of a round) never automatically bleed out or
//  self-destruct regardless of distance or time elapsed."*
//
//  🛑 v2.2.0 PATCHED ONE OF THE TWO AUTOMATIC KILLS, NOT BOTH. That is the
//  defect. Every script-side automatic zombie death in the whole 2,093-file
//  stock dump was enumerated for this fix - `dodamage( self.health` across the
//  entire tree, then every zombie_history() string naming a kill - and exactly
//  TWO of them fire on a timer:
//
//    1. _zm.gsc:3635  round_spawn_failsafe()   30s of not moving -> kill.
//                     Patched since v2.2.0, above.
//    2. _zm_spawner.gsc:548  zombie_assure_node()   the zombie could not path to
//                     ANY entrance node -> `wait 20` -> dodamage( health + 10 ).
//                     🛑 NEVER PATCHED. This is the one that was missed.
//
//  🌟 AND ITS TIMING IS THE USER'S "~1 MINUTE", read off the stock body
//  rather than estimated: zombie_bad_path() blocks up to 2s per candidate node,
//  the function walks the entrance-node list, then `wait 2`, then re-picks the
//  20 closest exterior_goals and walks those too, then `wait 20` before the
//  kill. Twenty bad candidates at 2s plus the two fixed waits is ~62 seconds.
//  round_spawn_failsafe's clock is a flat 30s and cannot produce that number.
//
//  🛑 AND "JUST DO NOT KILL IT" IS NOT A FIX HERE. Stock kills this zombie
//  because it is stranded with no path to anywhere; leaving it alive would end
//  the round FOREVER, which is a worse bug than the one being fixed and exactly
//  the reason the v2.2.0 banner gave for keeping the below-world kill. So with
//  the row on, this mod MOVES the zombie to a live spawn point instead of
//  damaging it. It is never killed, and it becomes reachable - which is what the
//  request actually asks for ("the player would have to actually kill the
//  zombies themself").
//
//  📝 The body below is stock's, verbatim, except that:
//    - the two /# #/ println blocks and the zombie_history() /
//      draw_line_ent_to_pos() calls are dropped. Both of those functions have
//      their ENTIRE bodies inside /# #/ (_zm_spawner.gsc:2602,
//      _zm_utility.gsc:2551), so in retail they do nothing at all.
//    - `start_pos` is dropped; stock assigns it and never reads it.
//    - zombie_bad_path() is called fully qualified, because this file is not
//      _zm_spawner.gsc.
//
//  Recovery with no rebuild, if the relocation ever misbehaves:
//      no_bleedout_relocate 0     suppress the kill but never move anything
//      no_bleedout 0              back to stock entirely

//  cola make the animations for rebuilding barriers twice as fast put a toggle
//  for it in the GAME tab called BETTER SPEED COLA right under the BETTER
//  DEADSHOT option."*
//
//  🌟 TREYARCH WROTE THIS FEATURE AND A TYPO SWITCHED IT OFF. Measured out of
//  the stock dump, not inferred:
//        _zm_blockers::has_blocker_affecting_perk()   returns the string
//              "specialty_fastreload"
//        _zm_blockers::replace_chunk()                tests it against
//              "speciality_fastreload"      <- an extra i
//  The comparison can never be true, so `scalar` stays 1.0 and Speed Cola has
//  never sped up boarding in retail BO2. Same class of shipped misspelling as
//  the LUI `beingAnimation` one this project already had to work around.
//  Treyarch's own dormant values are 0.31 for the perk and 0.2112 for its
//  upgrade - i.e. THEY intended 3.2x, not 2x.
//
//  🛑 THE ROW USES 2x, NOT TREYARCH'S 3.2x, BECAUSE THE USER GAVE A NUMBER.
//  "twice as fast" is an instruction, so scalar 0.5 is what ships. Stock's own
//  numbers are recorded here so the choice can be revisited in one line.
//
//  🛑 IT TAKES TWO FUNCTIONS, AND ONLY DOING replace_chunk WOULD BE A HALF FIX.
//  Repairing one board is the closing ANIMATION plus a fixed one-second pause
//  between boards - do_post_chunk_repair_delay(). That function ALREADY takes
//  has_perk as an argument and then ignores it, which is the same dormant hook
//  from the same author. Halving only the animation would leave the flat second
//  in place and the boards would not be anywhere near twice as fast.
//
//  📝 has_blocker_affecting_perk() is NOT replaced. It returns the correct
//  string already; the bug is on the reading side.
//  📝 Both bodies below are stock's, verbatim, with the marked lines changed.
//  📝 specialty_fastreload_upgrade is unreachable in retail - nothing ever
//  returns it from has_blocker_affecting_perk() - but its branch is kept and
//  scaled the same way so a future caller cannot fall back to 1.0.

    //  true when that field exists. `self` there is the BARRIER, the same entity
    //  passed in here as `barrier`. So writing the field makes STOCK'S OWN

//  zmqol_perma_perks  -  PERMA-PERKS on the GAME tab           (queue item 29)
//
//  User, 2026-08-20: one on/off switch covering every persistent upgrade the
//  base game already gives a map, and nothing more - *"don't add perma perks
//  that aren't meant to be on other maps, like perma phd for instance is a
//  buried only perma perk."*  Settled by them the same day: ENABLED means every
//  perma-perk the map has is active immediately, with no challenge progress
//  needed; DISABLED is stock, earned normally, and is the default.
//
//  SCOPE IS CORRECT BY CONSTRUCTION - NOTHING HERE REGISTERS AN UPGRADE.
//  level.pers_upgrades holds only what the map itself registered in its own
//  init_persistent_abilities(): TranZit and Die Rise set 13 each, Buried sets
//  the same 13 plus pers_upgrade_flopper (Perma-PhD), and Mob, Origins and
//  Nuketown set none at all, so level.pers_upgrades is never even created
//  there. Perma-PhD therefore cannot leak off Buried - this only satisfies the
//  threshold of names that are already in that table.
//
//  THE MECHANISM, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE SHORTCUT CHECKPOINT 125 REFUSED.
//  That shortcut was to set player.pers_upgrades_awarded[name] = 1 directly and
//  call the activation function by hand. It has a real race:
//  pers_upgrades_monitor() (_zm_pers_upgrades_system.gsc:44) re-tests every
//  upgrade whose own stat ticks during play, and when the real stat is still
//  below its threshold it takes the DOWNGRADE branch at :125 - awarded flag
//  back to 0 and "evt_player_downgrade" in the player's ear, mid-match.
//
//  AND THE DOWNGRADE DOES REVOKE THE EFFECT. That was checkpoint 125's open
//  question; it is now answered by grep, not by reasoning. Every perma-perk
//  effect reads self.pers_upgrades_awarded[<name>] AT THE POINT OF USE, not
//  once at activation - _zm_blockers.gsc:1481/1530 ("board"),
//  _zm_magicbox.gsc:1116 ("box_weapon"), _zm.gsc:1960/4136/4182/4372/4395
//  ("perk_lose", "flopper"), _zm_weapons.gsc:1165/2128 ("nube"),
//  _zm_laststand.gsc:1025 - and the pers_upgrade_*_active() watchers re-check
//  the same flag every iteration (_zm_pers_upgrades_functions.gsc:22, :43, :60,
//  :266, :299, :431, :607, :748, :1194). The flag IS the live authority, so a
//  downgrade silently switches the perk off. The shortcut was correctly refused.
//
//  WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD: MOVE THE THRESHOLD, NOT THE FLAG.
//  check_pers_upgrade_stat() (_zm_pers_upgrades_system.gsc:214) is one
//  comparison,  current_stat_value < stat_desired_value -> not awarded,  and
//  stat_desired_value is read out of
//  level.pers_upgrades[name].stat_desired_values[i], which is ordinary level
//  DATA this script may write. Set every entry to 0 and the comparison can
//  never fail - a stat is never negative - so:
//    - should_award is always 1, which makes the DOWNGRADE BRANCH UNREACHABLE.
//      The race is closed by construction, not mitigated.
//    - the award runs through STOCK'S OWN PATH at :82-119 - evt_player_upgrade,
//      the announcer VO, the "upgrade_aquired" fx, and
//      player thread [[ pers_upgrade.upgrade_active_func ]]() - so all six axes
//      of the completeness audit are stock's own, not this mod's imitation.
//    - NOTHING PERSISTENT IS WRITTEN. The obvious alternative was stock's own
//      grant path (_zm_devgui.gsc:172 zombie_devgui_ability_give), which calls
//      set_global_stat -> setdstat( "PlayerStatsList", ... ). That is the
//      player's SAVED PROFILE: it would hand out real permanent challenge
//      progress, and switching the row back to DISABLED could never undo it.
//      Rejected for that reason. Moving the threshold touches level state only,
//      so OFF restores stock exactly and immediately.
//
//  IMMEDIATE, VIA STOCK'S OWN TRIGGER. The monitor only looks at a player
//  whose stats moved this frame - unless self.pers_upgrade_force_test is set,
//  which short-circuits both the outer gate (:65) and
//  is_any_pers_upgrade_stat_updated() (:196). That is exactly how stock kicks
//  the first evaluation (_zm_stats.gsc:194) and how its own devgui grants one,
//  so this sets the same flag rather than inventing a trigger.
//
//  CLASSIC ONLY, AND THAT IS STOCK'S GATE, NOT ONE ADDED HERE.
//  pers_upgrades_monitor() returns early unless is_classic() (:48), and all
//  three init_persistent_abilities() are themselves wrapped in is_classic().
//  Survival and Grief have never had perma-perks; the row does nothing there.
//
//  ONE STOCK SIDE EFFECT, HANDLED RATHER THAN LEFT. wait_for_game_end()
//  (:145) zeroes the stats of any upgrade registered with
//  game_end_reset_if_not_achieved = 1 that the player did NOT achieve. Exactly
//  one is registered that way - "revive" (_zm_pers_upgrades.gsc:83) - and with
//  this row ON it always reads as achieved, so stock would skip that reset and
//  quietly preserve partial revive progress the player never earned.
//  zmqol_perma_perks_end_game() performs the reset itself against the REAL
//  threshold, so the row changes no saved stat in either direction.

//  zmqol_no_walkers_watch  -  NO WALKERS                            (v2.8.6)
//
//  User request, 2026-08-30: *"add an option into the patches tab NO WALKERS
//  which when set to enabled, from round 10 and onwards there will be no
//  walking zombies they will all be sprinters so that way people can train the
//  zombies up more efficiently without the awkward walkers spoiling the train"*.
//
//  🛑 DELIBERATELY A WATCHER, NOT A replaceFunc. Stock picks a speed in THREE
//  places and two of them are same-file unqualified calls, which replaceFunc
//  does not reliably intercept (AI_CONTEXT rule 3):
//
//      _zm_utility::set_run_speed        randomintrange -> walk / run / sprint
//      _zm_utility::set_run_speed_easy   easy difficulty, walk / run only
//      _zm_utility::change_zombie_run_cycle   forces "walk" outright on any
//                                             difficulty above easy - this is
//                                             the one that makes the walkers
//                                             that break a train
//
//  Polling covers all three, plus anything a map script sets on its own, and it
//  is self-correcting: a zombie that somehow ends up walking is fixed within a
//  second rather than staying wrong for its whole life.
//
//  🌟 IT CALLS STOCK'S OWN PRIMITIVE. set_zombie_run_cycle() is what does the
//  real work - assigning zombie_move_speed alone would leave the ANIMATION on
//  the old cycle, because the anim only re-reads it via zm_run::needsupdate(),
//  which that function calls (_zm_utility.gsc:210). It also refreshes
//  .deathanim, so gibbed-leg deaths stay correct.
