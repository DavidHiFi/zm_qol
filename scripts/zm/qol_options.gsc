//  qol_options  -  console-configurable options, adapted from BO2-Remix
// ============================================================================
//  Adds the dvars the user asked for from H:\Claude\BO2-Remix and NOTHING else
//  from that mod. Explicitly NOT ported: the walker removal, the power-up
//  rework, the bank/perma-perk/fridge/box patches, the round-255 and points
//  changes, the strat tester. Those are gameplay changes; this file is options.
//
//  Every GAMEPLAY option here is OFF by default, so a fresh install plays
//  exactly as it did before any of this existed. The HUD readouts are the
//  exception and always were: hud_timers, hud_health_bar and hud_remaining ship
//  on. (hud_timers was hud_timer + hud_round_timer until v2.1.3; the round
//  timer joined the defaults in v1.84.0 at the user's request.)
//
//  🛑 THREE THINGS WERE VERIFIED AGAINST THE SHIPPED GAME BEFORE BEING WRITTEN,
//  because each is the class of bug that has already cost this project a
//  release apiece - a name that reads fine and resolves to nothing:
//
//    1. strTok, string_to_float, getdvarintdefault are all real T6 builtins
//       (113 / 4 / 120 uses in the stock dump). array_slice, which an earlier
//       draft of the .help fix used, is NOT - it has zero uses and would have
//       failed at runtime.
//    2. The character models Remix hardcodes DO NOT EXIST on every map.
//       Unlinker --list across Farm's loaded zones finds only
//       c_zom_player_cdc_fb and c_zom_player_cia_fb - survival uses the CDC/CIA
//       teams, not the TranZit crew - so Remix's setmodel( "c_zom_player_
//       oldman_fb" ) would give an INVISIBLE PLAYER there. See qol_opt_character.
//    3. A client's HUD-element allowance is finite and this mod already spends
//       ~13 of it. That is what silently truncated the .help panel. So the two
//       NEW hud elements here are created only when their dvar is on, and never
//       on a player who has not asked for them.

    //  zmqol_minimal shipped in v1.95.1 as a plain getdvarintdefault() read with

//  mark in the top right of the user's screenshot.
//
//  🛑 IT CANNOT BE DRIVEN FROM qol_opt_hud_watcher(). Two reasons:
//    1. It is a SERVER hudelem (createservericon / createserverfontstring),
//       one shared element rather than one per player, so a per-player watcher
//       would have every player writing the same element.
//    2. It is ANIMATION-driven, not tick-driven - round_hud() runs
//       fadeovertime / scaleovertime / moveovertime sequences at each round
//       change. Writing its alpha on a timer would fight those animations.
//
//  So this only ever writes while the HUD is switched OFF, plus exactly once on
//  the off->on edge to put it back. While the HUD is on it never touches the
//  element, and the round animation is left completely alone.

//  qol_opt_lod_fix  -  stop models popping in at distance
//
//  What the user sees as "texture pop-in" on BO2 is LOD swapping: the renderer
//  drops rigid (world/prop) and skinned (character) models to lower detail
//  levels past a distance threshold. Treyarch tuned that for 2012 consoles, and
//  the fog exists partly to hide it.
//
//  📝 THE FOUR DVARS ARE REAL AND VERIFIED, not taken on trust from the forum
//  post they came from. All four appear in this install's own dvar dump
//  (console_zm.log) with these stock defaults:
//        r_lodBiasRigid    "0"
//        r_lodBiasSkinned  "0"
//        r_lodScaleRigid   "1"
//        r_lodScaleSkinned "1"
//  and Treyarch's own descriptions (BO2 Detailed DVARS.txt) give the direction:
//        r_lodBias*   "Bias the level of detail distance ... negative INCREASES detail"
//        r_lodScale*  "Scale the level of detail distance ... larger REDUCES detail"
//
//  🛑 SO ONLY TWO OF THE FOUR ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING HERE. r_lodScaleRigid and
//  r_lodScaleSkinned already sit at 1, which is the neutral value the advice
//  asks for - writing 1 over 1 is a no-op on a stock config. They are still
//  written, deliberately: this mod ships to other people, and a config that has
//  raised either of them (larger = less detail) would otherwise keep popping
//  models regardless of the bias. Writing them makes the result independent of
//  whatever is in the user's config, which is the whole point.
//
//  🛑 THESE ARE CLIENT RENDERER DVARS. Setting them from GSC works because this
//  mod runs through Plutonium's Mods menu, where the host IS the client - one
//  process. They are NOT networked, so on a dedicated server this would change
//  nothing for remote players. That is a limitation of the approach, not a bug.
//
//  Written only when the setting CHANGES, not on a timer - same discipline as
//  the hud_color watcher above, which exists because writing dvars every tick
//  is a lot of work for a value that changes when someone types at the console.

//  request, 2026-08-30: *"the graphics_boost console command for some reason
//  still exists??? I told you ages ago to get rid of that from my mod"*. The UI
//  row went in v2.6.6 but the dvar and its thread stayed, so the console command
//  was still there and still force-wrote render dvars on every load.
//
//  What could NOT be dropped is the self-heal, because it repairs a config that
//  kills the game before any script runs:
//
//  Every build from v2.0.7 to v2.2.3 wrote r_aaSamples 16 the moment GRAPHICS
//  BOOST was thrown. That dvar is ARCHIVED and LATCHED, so the 16 sits in
//  plutonium_zm.cfg afterwards and is applied by the renderer restart that runs
//  as the mod loads. 16x MSAA is a sample count D3D cannot create, so device
//  creation returns E_INVALIDARG and the game dies at the frontend:
//
//      Reading stats... / Reading backup stats...
//      COM_ERROR (0) E_INVALIDARG ... @ 0x74C0E0

//  Electric Cherry's missing zap
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  v1.35.0 fixed the perk's DAMAGE - the guard bug that left player_thread_give
//  unset, so electric_cherry_reload_attack() never started. The sound did not
//  come back with it, and this is why: that function plays
//  "zmb_cherry_explode", and Electric Cherry is a Mob of the Dead perk, so its
//  aliases live in Mob of the Dead's soundbank. On Farm the loaded banks are
//  cmn_root, zmb_common, zmb_patch and zmb_survival_transit - none of them
//  Alcatraz's - so the alias resolves to nothing and the perk fires silently.
//  Exactly the wall the Wunderfizz spin sound is stuck behind, and it cannot be
//  fixed by script: a bank loads from the folder of the zone that declared it.
//
//  ✅ v1.39.0 — IT NOW PLAYS THE REAL SOUND, not a substitute. The mod builds
//  its own soundbank (see build_ff.bat), so zmb_cherry_explode's actual audio -
//  raw\sound\wpn\grenade\taser_mine\explode\tazer_mine, with Alcatraz's own
//  volume, bus and 125/625/750 distance curve - ships inside mod.all under the
//  mod-private name zmqol_cherry_zap and resolves on every map.
//
//  🛑 v1.38.0's substitute was zmb_hellhound_bolt, and the reason the user still
//  heard nothing is that THERE IS NO SUCH ALIAS. Dumping every bank a zombies
//  map can load (cmn_root, zmb_common, zmb_code_post_gfx, and the per-map banks)
//  and searching all of them finds it in none. It was never verified, only
//  described as verified. So was zmb_tombstone_looper in v1.32.0, which produced
//  the same silence for the same reason.
//
//  The check that settles this in seconds, for any alias, before shipping it:
//      Unlinker --include-assets soundbank -o <dir> <map>.ff
//      grep "^<alias>," <dir>\soundbank\*.aliases.csv
//  A missing alias is SILENT, never an error, so nothing in any log will tell
//  you. Look it up.
//
//  The listener itself is unchanged and was always right: stock notifies
//  "electric_cherry_start" on the player one line before its own playsound
//  (_zm_perk_electric_cherry.gsc:271).
//
//  Skipped on the two maps that own the perk, where stock's own alias resolves
//  and playing ours as well would just double the zap.

    //  User, twice: "the night mode toggle command in console still is scuffed
    //  as hell, when i enable it the screen seems to go just black."
    //
    //  Two findings, both from Plutonium's own dvar_descriptions.json rather
    //  than from reasoning:
    //
    //  1. "r_exposureValue": "exposure ev stops". It is an EV OFFSET, and every
    //     stop HALVES the image. The old values came from Remix - 3.9 by
    //     default, up to 5.6 on Nuketown - which is between 1/15th and 1/48th
    //     brightness. That is the black screen, on its own, with nothing else
    //     wrong.
    //
    //  2. 🛑 THE ENTIRE vc_* FAMILY DOES NOT EXIST ON THIS BUILD. vc_yl, vc_yh,
    //     vc_rgbl and vc_rgbh return ZERO matches in dvar_descriptions.json,
    //     while r_exposureValue and r_filmUseTweaks are both present. Those four
    //     lines were the half that tinted the picture blue and lifted it back
    //     up - so only the darkening half ever applied. They are deleted rather
    //     than left in: a setclientdvar to a non-existent dvar is silent, and
    //     four silent lines are exactly what made this look like a colour
    //     problem instead of an exposure one.
    //
    //  The port was faithful to Remix. Remix simply targets a build where the
    //  other half of it works.
    //
    //  📝 TUNABLE, because the RIGHT number needs eyes and this has already
    //  cost boots. Default 1.25 stops - a bit over half brightness, which reads
    //  as dusk rather than a blackout. Change it live with:
    //        night_exposure 2      (darker)
    //        night_exposure 0.75   (lighter)
    //  then tell me the value that looks right and it becomes the default.

    //          _zm_nightmode.gsc  - a dedicated, shipped night-mode mod.

    //  came from BO2-Remix\src\scripts\zm\remix\_visual.gsc, which sets vc_rgbh
    //  TWICE:
    //        line 86:  vc_rgbh  "0.07 0 0.25 0"      <- the real value
    //        line 90:  vc_rgbh  "0.015 0 0.07 0"     <- overwrites it
    //  vc_rgbh is the HIGHLIGHT end of the grade. Capped at 0.015 the brightest
    //  the picture can ever be is ~1.5%, which is a black screen. The working
    //  mod sets it ONCE, to "0.1 0 0.3 0". Remix's second line is a bug that
    //  was faithfully copied in.
    //
    //  Two more values were wrong in the same way, and both push the same
    //  direction:
    //        r_lightTweakSunLight      zm_qol 16  ->  working mod 1
    //        r_sky_intensity_factor0   zm_qol 3   ->  working mod 0

//  🛑 v1.90.3 - THIS LOOP WAS KILLING ORIGINS, MOB AND BURIED AT 0:06.
//
//  User, 2026-08-14: Origins, Mob and Buried all failed to reach the game
//  with "CL_CGameNeedsServerCommand: A reliable command was cycled out."
//  TranZit and Die Rise were fine. All three died at exactly 0:06 server
//  time (games_mp.log), which is a threshold, not a race.
//
//  🌟 setclientdvar IS A RELIABLE SERVER COMMAND, and this function emitted
//  20 (prison/tomb) to 40 (buried) of them PER SECOND, from spawn, forever.
//  Six seconds of that is ~120-240 queued commands; the client's reliable
//  ring holds 128, so the oldest was overwritten before the client - still
//  loading, not yet acking - had read it. That is the error, verbatim.
//
//  🛑 AND THE EXIT CONDITION COULD NEVER BE TRUE. setclientdvar does not
//  write back into the value the SERVER's getdvar() returns. Measured, not
//  assumed: across 13 logged games the load-time dvar dump reports
//  r_exposureValue "3" and r_sky_intensity_factor0 "1" every single time,
//  including immediately after night mode set them to 3.5/3.9/4 and 0. So
//  `while ( getdvar(...) != 0 )` was always an infinite loop - here AND in
//  the source mod, where the same line compares a string to an int. It is
//  written as for(;;) now because that is what it always was; pretending
//  otherwise hid the real cost of the wait.
//
//  📝 WHY IT ONLY SURFACED NOW. It needs a second per-frame consumer to tip
//  it over: every one of these maps booted fine yesterday with night mode
//  ON and the velocity meter OFF, and died today with both ON. Nine games,
//  no counterexample. The meter is not the bug - it is one hudelem on
//  setvalue() - it is simply the load that exposed this one.
//
//  THE FIX IS A RATE CUT, NOT A RETUNE. The prison/tomb ramp keeps its
//  exact trajectory: it was 0.05 units per 0.05s and is now 0.2 per 0.2s -
//  the same 1.0 units/second, from the same start value to the same 0.
//  Buried's clamp is unchanged except that it re-asserts every 0.2s rather
//  than every 0.05s. Worst case over the first six seconds drops from
//  120-240 commands to 30-60, comfortably inside the ring.

//
//  Remix hardcodes the models: setmodel( "c_zom_player_oldman_fb" ),
//  setviewmodel( "c_zom_oldman_viewhands" ), and so on for the TranZit crew.
//  Those models are NOT on every map. Unlinker --list over every fastfile a
//  Farm survival game loads finds exactly two player bodies -
//  c_zom_player_cdc_fb and c_zom_player_cia_fb - because survival uses the
//  CDC/CIA teams rather than the crew. Setting a model the level never shipped
//  gives an invisible player, the same failure that made the Wunderfizz bottle
//  vanish.
//
//  So this sets characterindex and calls the LEVEL'S OWN character function
//  instead. Stock give_personality_characters() already switches on exactly
//  that variable (zm_transit.gsc:1153) and stock even has a dev-only force_char
//  dvar doing this very thing at :1149 - but inside a /# #/ block, so it is
//  stripped from the release build and unreachable from the console. This is
//  that, made available.
//
//  Because the level picks the model, it can only ever pick one the level has.
//  On Farm you get the CDC/CIA variants, on TranZit proper the crew - and on
//  Origins and Mob of the Dead nothing happens, which is correct: their
//  characters are story-fixed and stock guards them the same way.

//  Read once at setup rather than watched: the buildables are wired up during

//  otherwise would just be confusing.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ============================================================================
//  🛑 v2.9.13 - THIS OPTION DID THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT ITS ROW SAYS. REWRITTEN.
//
//  User, 2026-08-31: *"make sure that the option to enable power for the current
//  map works as intended, the option in the cheats menu."*
//
//  What the menu promises (ui\t6\menus\optionssettings.lua:2054, CHEATS tab):
//      "NO POWER NEEDED"  -  "Perks and doors work without power."
//
//  What the old body actually did: returned immediately on every map except
//  TranZit, and on TranZit pointed the TURBINE and JET GUN buildables at a null
//  stub - i.e. it REMOVED the only way to get power there. A row sitting on the
//  CHEATS tab, promising perks and doors without power, instead made the map
//  strictly harder and did nothing at all on the other five. Its own comment
//  called it "TranZit's power-free challenge", so the code was coherent with
//  itself and simply never matched the row it was wired to.
//
//  🌟 THE FIX USES THE GAME'S OWN CHEAT, NOT AN INVENTION. Stock's devgui does
//  exactly one thing for its "power_on" button (_zm_devgui.gsc:900-902):
//      case "power_on":  flag_set( "power_on" );  break;
//  and "power_on" is flag_init()'d in CORE _zm.gsc:1133, so it exists on every
//  map, not just one - confirmed in the dump, and every map's own scripts read
//  it (TranZit 23 references, Buried 13, Die Rise 8, Mob 8, Origins 5,
//  Nuketown 3). Perk machines, Pack-a-Punch and power doors are all driven off
//  it through _zm_power.gsc's powered-item list, which is why setting the one
//  flag is enough and no per-map special-casing is needed.
//
//  Watched rather than read once, so the row is live like BLEEDOUT BAR: flip it
//  mid-game and the lights come on. Turning it back OFF deliberately does NOT
//  cut the power again - if you had legitimately switched the power on, clearing
//  the flag would strand every door and machine you had already paid for. The
//  row is one-way within a match, and that is a deliberate choice, not an
//  oversight.
//
// ============================================================================
//  🛑 v2.11.22 - THE FLAG ALONE WAS NEVER THE WHOLE CHEAT. AUDITED CALL BY CALL.
//
//  User, 2026-09-04: *"make sure that the no power needed cheat works as
//  intended and actually bypasses power being disabled restrictions etc."*
//
//  v2.9.13 set flag "power_on" and stopped there. That is genuinely most of it -
//  _zm_power.gsc's watch_global_power() picks the flag up and powers every
//  registered item (perk machines, Pack-a-Punch, electric doors) - but a diff
//  against what the game's OWN power switches do found five gaps, every one of
//  them read out of the stock dump, not guessed:
//
//   1. 🌟 THE CLIENT WAS NEVER TOLD. Buried (zm_buried_power.gsc:31-33) and Die
//      Rise (zm_highrise.gsc:1136) both clientnotify AND set the clientfield
//      "zombie_power_on". Nothing in this mod did either, and the client half of
//      power hangs entirely off it: _zm.csc:56's callback turns the field into
//      the "ZPO" notify, zpo_listener (:580) turns THAT into "power_on", and
//      _zm.csc:886 perk_start_up() waits on it before it will light a single
//      perk machine. Same story for the map ambience - zm_highrise_amb.csc:141
//      and zm_transit_amb.csc:208 both wait for it. So the machines worked while
//      staying dark and silent, which is exactly what the user saw.
//      (TranZit is the exception and always was: wait_for_power() at
//      zm_transit_power.gsc:339 watches the flag server-side and sets the
//      clientfield itself, which is why TranZit looked more correct than the
//      others.)
//   2. LOCAL ELECTRIC DOORS were skipped by design. set_global_power() (:365)
//      refuses any item with power_sources == 1, and that is precisely how a
//      local_electric_door registers unless level.power_local_doors_globally is
//      set (:88-93). TranZit is the only map with them - its turbine doors -
//      so the row promised "doors work without power" and left those shut.
//   3. Doors that DID power up could close again: level.local_doors_stay_open
//      was never set, so door_think()'s close half (:588, :625) still ran.
//   4. Die Rise's lighting never changed - its switch ends stop_exploder(10);
//      exploder(11) (zm_highrise.gsc:1138-1139) and the map stayed dark.
//   5. TranZit's SECOND flag, "switches_on", was never set. It gates the reactor
//      event (powerevent(), :382), the Avogadro's power-plant behaviour
//      (_zm_ai_avogadro.gsc:1295) and four side-quest checks (zm_transit_sq.gsc
//      :962, :994, :1037, :1118), all of which test it separately from power_on.
//
//  🌟 THE FIX IS AGAIN TREYARCH'S OWN CODE. _zm_game_module.gsc:119 is
//  turn_power_on_and_open_doors() - the exact thing Grief and the TranZit
//  survival sub-maps call - and it covers 1, 2 and 3 in one call:
//      level.local_doors_stay_open = 1;
//      level.power_local_doors_globally = 1;
//      flag_set( "power_on" );
//      level setclientfield( "zombie_power_on", 1 );
//      + a direct power_on / local_power_on notify to every zombie_door
//  It lives in maps\mp\zombies\_zm_game_module, which AI_CONTEXT rule 2 lists as
//  globally safe from a root script (maps\mp\zombies\_zm*).
//
//  4 and 5 are map-specific, so they live in the map's own file and hang off the
//  "zmqol_no_power_applied" notify this function raises:
//      zm_highrise\zm_highrise.gsc  the two exploders
//      zm_transit\zm_transit.gsc    flag "switches_on"
//      zm_tomb\zm_tomb.gsc          Origins is a special case - see below
//
//  🛑 ORIGINS: THE ROW DID NOTHING AT ALL THERE, AND STILL WOULD.
//  zm_tomb_standard.gsc:20 sets power_on itself the moment the blackscreen
//  lifts, so the old code printed "already on, nothing to do" and left. Origins
//  does not gate perks on the power flag at all: zm_tomb_capture_zones.gsc:117
//  installs level.custom_perk_validation = ::check_perk_machine_valid, which
//  reads the GENERATOR ZONE's own "player_controlled" ent_flag (:where the
//  machine's str_zone_name points) and plays the "power_off" line when it is
//  clear. So on Origins the cheat has to capture the generators, and that is
//  what the map hook does - through stock's own set_player_controlled_area() /
//  generator_state_power_up(), the same path a real capture takes.
//
//  Mob of the Dead and Nuketown also set power_on at blackscreen
//  (zm_alcatraz_standard.gsc:20, zm_nuked_standard.gsc:21) and, unlike Origins,
//  gate NOTHING else on it - Mob's only other references are voice lines. The
//  row is correctly a no-op on those two, and the log says so.
// ============================================================================
//  ============================================================================
//  🌟 v2.11.24 - THE ROW IS A TOGGLE NOW. TURNING IT OFF TAKES THE POWER BACK.
//
//  User, 2026-09-04, asked for exactly this after finding the Wunderfizz still
//  purchasable with the row switched off: the row had latched on b_applied and
//  never looked at the dvar again, so power granted was power kept.
//
//  🌟 THE WHOLE POWER-OFF IS ONE STOCK LINE: flag_clear( "power_on" ).
//  _zm_power.gsc:43 watch_global_power() is a two-way loop -
//      flag_wait( "power_on" );      set_global_power( 1 );
//      flag_waitopen( "power_on" );  set_global_power( 0 );
//  - and set_global_power( 0 ) walks every registered powered item calling its
//  power_off_func: perk_power_off (:614) kills the machine's trigger think,
//  restarts it unpowered, deletes the perk_hum and perk_pause()s the perk;
//  pap_power_off (:663) notifies "Pack_A_Punch_off" and restores the dummy;
//  door_power_off (:488) notifies the door "power_off". Nothing is
//  reimplemented here. Stock's own devgui power button is the same single line
//  (_zm_devgui.gsc:904), and TranZit's switch - which is a real two-way switch
//  in stock - clears the same flag at zm_transit_power.gsc:90.
//
//  The client half is setclientfield( "zombie_power_on", 0 ), which is what
//  zm_transit_power.gsc:350 does on the way down. That is what makes the perk
//  machines go dark and quiet again and swings map ambience back (_zm.csc:56 ->
//  "ZPO" -> zpo_listener), and it is what re-locks the Wunderfizz through
//  wunderfizz.gsc's live gate.
//
//  🛑 ONLY GIVE BACK WHAT THE ROW ITSELF TOOK. Everything below is guarded on
//  level.zmqol_no_power_turned_it_on, set only in the branch that actually
//  turned the power on. A player who flipped the real switch keeps their power,
//  and the row is correctly a no-op both ways on Origins, Mob, Nuketown and
//  every survival start, where power_on was already set before it ran.
//
//  🛑 WHAT THIS CANNOT UNDO, AND WHY - DOORS THE ROW OPENED STAY OPEN.
//  Stock's turn_power_on_and_open_doors() parks level.local_doors_stay_open at
//  1, and _zm_blockers.gsc:625 / :588 make door_think() *return* on that - the
//  thread that would ever close the door is gone, not parked. Worse, local
//  electric doors were registered in standard_powered_items() with
//  power_sources = 1 before the row ran, and set_global_power() skips exactly
//  those (:374), so the flag can never reach them anyway. Closing them again
//  would mean hand-rolling a door sweep that re-blocks doors and clears their
//  script_flags mid-round - which can shut a zone under a player's feet - so it
//  is deliberately NOT done. Told to the user rather than shipped half-working.

//  classic mode map the player is playing on. This option being there is only to

//  it off puts the MAP back to unpowered - it must not take the drinks out of

//
//  🛑 WHERE THE PERK LOSS ACTUALLY CAME FROM - READ, NOT ASSUMED.
//  set_global_power( 0 ) (_zm_power.gsc:365) walks every registered item and
//  calls its power_off_func. For a perk machine that is perk_power_off (:614),
//  whose LAST line is _zm_perks::perk_pause(). perk_pause (:2633) unsetperks the
//  drink on EVERY player and, for specialty_additionalprimaryweapon, calls
//  _zm::take_additionalprimaryweapon(). perk_unpause hands the perk back on
//  re-power but NOT the third gun. The user was right about the feel: the EMP
//  grenade reaches that same perk_pause through perk_pause_all_perks( :2705 ).
//
//  THE OTHER OFF-FUNCS WERE READ TOO, AND TAKE NOTHING FROM A PLAYER, so this

//  ZONE NAME  -  the permanent location readout, above the perk row
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User, 2026-09-05, with a screenshot: *"make the location indicator hud
//  option for my mod always show up here, above the perks just like how the
//  strat tester mod does, but not in yellow, in white like how it is currently,
//  and make sure it doesn't fade away off screen."*
//
//  🛑 THIS ROW HAS NEVER DRAWN A SINGLE CHARACTER, AND THAT IS THE REAL BUG.
//  It used to read `self.zone_name`, and a PLAYER never has one. Measured, not
//  assumed - the only assignments to that field in the whole 2,093-file stock
//  dump are
//        _zm_spawner.gsc:2689      self.zone_name = spot.zone_name;   (an AI)
//        _zm_zonemgr.gsc:216, 355  spots[i].zone_name = ...           (a struct)
//  and there is not one assignment anywhere in this mod's own tree either. So
//  isdefined( self.zone_name ) was always false, str_zone was always "", and
//  this element has sat in the bottom-left corner rendering an empty string for
//  every version it has existed. The old header comment claiming _zm_zonemgr
//  "maintains" it on every map was wrong: it maintains it on zombies.
//
//  🌟 SO THE ONLY LOCATION READOUT THE USER HAS EVER SEEN is the centre-screen
//  pop-up in quality_of_life.gsc::zonecheck(), which is white
//  (show_grief_hud_msg sets color ( 1, 1, 1 )) and fades out after 3.25 s
//  (fadeovertime( 1 ) -> alpha 0). That is exactly the "white" and the "fades
//  away" of the request, so what is being asked for is: make the permanent
//  readout actually work, and put it where the strat tester's one is.
//  📝 The pop-up is left alone - it was not part of the ask, and both it and
//  this row are governed by the same hud_zone switch.
//
//  -- THE POSITION -----------------------------------------------------------
//  🛑 v2.14.8 - MOVED, AND THE OLD SPOT IS THE BUG. User, 2026-09-06:
//  *"the zone notifier is colliding with other hud elements in origins,
//  potentially other maps too, so move the zone notifier below where users name
//  shows up, just underneath it."* The old position was Strat-Tester-BO2's
//  (x 8 / y -95 on "user_left"/"user_bottom", +15 Buried, +10 Origins), and on
//  Origins that lands ON the perk icon column - the user's screenshot shows
//  "No Man's Land" drawn straight through a perk icon.
//
//  🌟 THE NEW SPOT IS THE PLAYER NAME'S OWN, ONE LINE LOWER, AND THE NUMBERS
//  ARE MEASURED OFF THAT SCREENSHOT (2000x1125, so the 640x480 virtual screen
//  scales by 1125/480 = 2.34 vertically):
//        "Zombies: N"  ink rows 1004-1023  ->  virtual centre 432.5
//        "DavidHiFi"   ink rows 1074-1091  ->  virtual centre 461.9
//  quality_of_life.gsc draws those two with setpoint( "LEFT", "BOTTOM_LEFT",
//  -45, -12 ) and ( ..., -45, 18 ) - offsets 30 apart, centres 29.4 apart - so
//  ONE UNIT OF setpoint's y IS ONE VIRTUAL PIXEL, DOWNWARD, and this anchor's
//  origin sits at virtual y 444 (the 7.5% safe-area line). Everything below
//  follows from that: the screen bottom is offset ~35.8, the name's ink ends at
//  offset ~21.4, and a "small" 1.2 line is ~8.1 virtual px tall.
//
//  y = 29 therefore puts this line's centre 11 below the name, its ink from
//  offset ~25 to ~33, which is a ~3.7 px gap under the name and ~2.7 px of clear
//  screen below it. x = -45 is the name's own x, so the two left edges line up.
//
//  📝 IT IS TIGHT BECAUSE THE STACK ALREADY ENDS AT THE SCREEN EDGE - there
//  are only ~14.5 virtual px under the name. If it reads as too close to the
//  bottom, y is the one number to change.
//
//  🛑 THE TWO PER-MAP NUDGES ARE GONE WITH IT. +15 on Buried and +10 on
//  Origins existed to clear those maps' lower perk rows; anchored under the name
//  they would only push this line off the bottom of the screen.
//
//  📝 IF THE HEALTH BAR ROW IS OFF, SO IS THE NAME - quality_of_life.gsc's
//  qol_health_hud_create() builds both as one set - and this line then sits alone
//  where the name would have been. That is a fixed, predictable spot rather than
//  a floating one, so it is left as is.
//
//  🛑 THEIR FONT IS NOT COPIED. hud.gsc:306 asks for "hudsmall", which is not a
//  T6 font - the engine rejects it with  "hudsmall" is not a valid value for
//  hudelem field "font"  and silently falls back to the default. This project
//  has already paid for that exact error once, on the zombie counter
//  (quality_of_life.gsc, createfontstring( "small", 1.2 ) and the long note
//  above it). "small" is a name from the engine's own list, so it stays.
//
//  🛑 AND THEIR FADE IS NOT COPIED EITHER, which is the third part of the ask:
//  hud.gsc:334-341 fades the text to alpha 0, re-texts it and fades it back in
//  on every zone change. This element is created at alpha 1 and nothing ever
//  writes its alpha again - qol_opt_show() is deliberately never called on it,
//  and qol_opt_tint() only touches .color.
//
//  📝 WHITE COSTS NO CODE. hud_color defaults to "1 1 1", the watcher above
//  already tints this element from it, and a fresh hudelem is white anyway - so
//  "white like how it is currently" is the state both paths already produce,
//  and the colour stays user-configurable instead of being hardcoded here.
//
//  -- WHERE THE NAME COMES FROM ----------------------------------------------
//  self.currentzone, which quality_of_life.gsc::zonecheck() already maintains
//  per player every 0.2 s out of its own get_zone_name() - the friendly names
//  ("Bus Depot", "Diner", "The Crazy Place"), map by map, for all six maps.
//
//  🌟 REUSING THAT CACHE RATHER THAN CALLING get_zone_name() HERE IS THE POINT.
//  get_zone_name() -> _zm_zonemgr::get_player_zone() walks every zone key and
//  istouching()es every volume of each one. This function is called from
//  qol_opt_hud_watcher()'s permanent 0.25 s loop, so calling it here would run
//  that whole walk a second time, four times a second, for a value another loop
//  already holds. It also keeps this file free of a cross-file call.
//
//  📝 A NAME CONTAINING "_" IS SKIPPED AND THE LAST GOOD ONE STAYS ON SCREEN.
//  Unnamed pockets read as their raw key ("zone_diner_roof"). zonecheck() only
//  writes currentzone for friendly names while hud_zone is ON, but its
//  hud_zone-OFF branch writes the raw key unfiltered - so someone who switches
//  the row on while standing in one of those pockets would otherwise get
//  "zone_diner_roof" in the corner. Holding the previous text is also simply
//  better for a permanent readout: "Diner" stays up while you are on the diner
//  roof.

//
//  User, 2026-08-21: *"my mod has the round counter at the top right of the
//  screen like cold war zombies ... it'd be cool to have an option in the hud
//  tab ... to be able to have it on the top left (same vertical y coords, just
//  on the top left instead of top right, same as bo4 zombies)."*
//
//  🌟 THE MIRROR IS DERIVED FROM TWO SHIPPED ELEMENTS, NOT GUESSED. T6 hudelem
//  x is measured from the SAFE-AREA edge named by horzalign, and it grows
//  OUTWARD from that edge into the margin. Both directions are already in this
//  file with working values:
//        round_hud()   horzalign "right", x = +25   (top right, 25 into the margin)
//        healthbar     horzalign "left",  x = -45   (bottom left, 45 into the margin)
//  So the exact mirror of the round counter's +25 on the right is -25 on the
//  left, and it lands the same distance in from the screen edge.
//
//  🛑 THE WHOLE STACK MOVES, NOT JUST THE NUMBER. timer() and
//  qol_options.gsc::qol_opt_round_timer_hud() are calibrated to sit directly
//  under the round counter and both carried its x = 25 verbatim - the comment
//  above timer() says so and warns that changing one without the other splits
//  the stack. All three now read this one anchor. Only the SIDE changes; every
//  y is untouched, which is exactly what the user asked for.
