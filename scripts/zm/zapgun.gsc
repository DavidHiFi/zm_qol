// ============================================================================
//  zapgun.gsc  -  THE WAVE GUN / ZAP GUNS, COMPLETE                (v2.10.14)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  v2.9.18-v2.10.13 shipped the split Zap Guns alone, on the zm_ezz3.0
//  package's converted models, because the combined Wave Gun existed only in T5
//  form and nothing on this machine could compile a T6 xmodel. The user's
//  directive of 2026-09-03 delivered the missing half: Zombies Declassified
//  BETA 1 (Logo2K's PC port of the cancelled BO2 DLC5) ships Moon as a native
//  T6 zone, and that zone carries Treyarch's ENTIRE Wave Gun package in T6
//  form - the six weapon defs, the six models, 49 view anims, all 28 effects,
//  the sound bank, and this very script's T6 original,
//  maps\mp\zombies\_zm_weap_microwavegun.gsc. Nothing below is a lookalike.
//
//  THIS FILE IS THAT T6 ORIGINAL, PORTED. It was carved out of the DLC5
//  zm_moon.ff and decompiled with gsc-tool (scratchpad gsc_carve\, checkpoint
//  201); every function keeps its original name and order so a diff against
//  the decompile reads line for line. Every stock API it leans on was
//  grep-verified in the gsc-dump on 2026-09-03: register_zombie_damage_callback
//  and register_zombie_death_animscript_callback (_zm_spawner core - the older
//  banner here that claimed T6 lacked them was wrong), get_round_enemy_array,
//  get_array_of_closest, pointonsegmentnearesttopoint, damageconetrace,
//  network_safe_play_fx_on_tag, hasanimstatefromasd, "thundergun_fling" score.
//  Stock's own core already knows these weapon names: _zm_magicbox draws the
//  second gun in the box, _zm_perks upgrades the dual pair when you Pack-a-Punch
//  holding the combined gun, _zm_audio excludes microwave kills from the kill
//  counter, _zm.gsc lists the pair as pistols.
//
//  WHAT DIFFERS FROM THE ORIGINAL, AND WHY (each one measured, none guessed):
//   1. NO CLIENTFIELDS. Moon registers two 1-bit "actor" fields for the client
//      sizzle visuals. On every map this mod runs on, only the instant-pop
//      branch of microwavegun_sizzle_zombie is reachable (see 2), and that
//      branch's whole client job is one fx + one sound at the zombie - so the
//      pop is broadcast from the server here (zmqol_mgun_pop), like every other
//      broadcast effect in this mod. zapgun.csc carries the include_weapon
//      mirror only.
//
//      🛑 CORRECTED 2026-09-06 - THE BIT BUDGET WAS NEVER THE REASON, AND THE
//      OLD "31/32" HERE WAS ORIGINS' NUMBER ON A MAP THIS GUN IS SWITCHED OFF
//      FOR. Re-measured from the per-map dumps in T6-Data-Archive-main\ZM\
//      Clientfields\ (awk '$1=="actor"{s+=$4}'), the actor set on the four maps
//      this gun DOES run on is nearly empty:
//          zm_transit  4-5 / 32      zm_highrise 4-5 / 32
//          zm_nuked      4 / 32      zm_prison  11-13 / 32
//      (32/32 is zm_buried and 31/32 is zm_tomb - the two maps in the gate
//      above.) Two 1-bit fields would fit with room to spare. The real blocker
//      is the material, see 2. Do not restore the fields expecting the swell.
//   2. THE SWELL IS UNREACHABLE, FOR TWO INDEPENDENT REASONS. Both measured
//      2026-09-06, either one alone is fatal to it:
//        a) THE ANIMATION. The zm_death_sizzle / zm_death_zap animstates live
//           in Moon's aitypes; a stock aitype's compiled anim list cannot take
//           them (§45), so hasanimstatefromasd() is false everywhere here and
//           the original's own fallbacks run. No float-up death.
//        b) THE SHADER. Moon's microwavegun_bloat() (its .csc, decompiled from
//           the DLC5 zone) is not an fx at all - it ramps a shader constant,
//           mapshaderconstant(...,"scriptVector3") then setshaderconstant with
//           the fraction in the W component, 0 -> 0.5 over 2500 ms. That only
//           renders because Moon's zombie materials carry a MaximumSwell
//           constant (literal 20,0,0,1) on the techset
//           mc_sw4_3d_char_cloth_4z8fq5wu_DLC5. Retail's zombie material -
//           mc/mtl_c_zom_dlc0_zombie_hazmat_body_1, techset
//           mc_sw4_3d_char_cloth_4z8fq5wu, no _dlc5 - dumps "constants": [].
//           So the call would be a silent no-op here. Delivering the swell
//           means owning a DLC5 techset plus a re-authored material for every
//           zombie body variant on every map, which changes how all zombies
//           render at all times - not a Wave Gun change.
//      🌟 AND THE FALLBACK IS NOT A COMPROMISE: on a map with no sizzle
//      animstate Moon's OWN code takes the same instant_explode branch, which
//      sets the expand clientfield with initial_hit_occurred still false, and
//      that lands on its client else-branch = the mist fx + wpn_mgun_explode_
//      zombie. Byte for byte what zmqol_mgun_pop() does from the server.
//      The animstate code is kept verbatim so the diff stays honest.
//   3. NO VOICE LINES. Moon's kill/pickup vox ("micro_single", "micro_dual",
//      "wpck_microwave") are Moon-character aliases no stock map carries, so the
//      create_and_play_dialog calls are out and the pickup vox category is "".
//   4. THE BOSS HOOK AND THE SHIELD GUARD, like the three sibling guns: on Mob
//      the first hit takes Brutus's helmet, the second kills
//      (zm_prison.gsc zmqol_brutus_ww_hit); magic-bullet-shielded zombies are
//      left to their scripts.
//   5. THE DAMAGE-MOD TEST IS WIDER. Moon accepts the zap only as MOD_IMPACT.
//      Nothing here could measure what mod a retail projectile impact reports,
//      so any non-melee damage from a zap-gun def counts - the def cannot deal
//      any other kind, so the wider test cannot misfire.
//   6. The dev-only debug prints and the never-threaded microwavegun_sound_thread
//      are dropped.
//
//  🛑 MAP GATE: off on Buried and Origins, exactly like its three siblings
//  (teslagun.gsc's banner: those two sit at engine ceilings and adding more
//  crashes them). The gate MUST stay identical to zapgun.csc - a box weapon
//  included on one side only is the EXE_CLIENT_FIELD_MISMATCH class.

// ============================================================================
//  User, 2026-09-04, TranZit: *"the wave gun for some reason doesn't deal any
//  damage to the denizens whilst i was testing in tranzit"*.
//
//  🌟 MEASURED CAUSE, one flag. The sizzle cone built its candidate list from
//  get_round_enemy_array() (_zm_utility.gsc), and that function's whole body is
//
//      enemies = getaispeciesarray( level.zombie_team, "all" );
//      ... if ( isdefined( enemies[i].ignore_enemy_count ) && enemies[i].ignore_enemy_count )
//              continue;
//
//  and the denizen sets exactly that flag on itself at spawn -
//  _zm_ai_screecher.gsc:376, `self.ignore_enemy_count = 1`, four lines after
//  `self.isscreecher = 1`. So a denizen was never a candidate and the beam
//  passed straight through it. Nothing was wrong with the damage; the target
//  was never in the list.
//
//  🛑 THE FIX ADDS DENIZENS AND NOTHING ELSE. Every special AI in the game
//  carries that same flag - Brutus, the Ghost, the Sloth, Mechz, the Avogadro -
//  and sweeping them all in would quietly turn the Wave Gun into a boss-killer
//  nobody asked for. The list is widened by the denizen's OWN marker,
//  self.isscreecher, so only denizens come back. Everything they then go
//  through is the path a normal zombie already takes.
//
//  📝 Nothing leaks. screecher_cleanup() (_zm_ai_screecher.gsc:924) is threaded
//  at spawn and parks on `self waittill( "death" )`, so the dodamage kill runs
//  it and level.zombie_screecher_count is decremented exactly as it is for any
//  other denizen death. The pop fx already falls back from J_SpineLower to
//  J_Spine1 to getcentroid(), so a rig without those tags costs the garnish and
//  never the kill.
//
//  📝 Built by hand rather than with arraycombine(): that name is nowhere in
//  the stock dump's own utility files, so its signature would have been a
//  guess. get_round_enemy_array() reads the same getaispeciesarray() this does
//  and drops every denizen, so the two halves cannot overlap.

// ============================================================================
//  User, 2026-09-05, TranZit: *"the wave gun for some reason deals no damage to
//  denizens"* - the SECOND report of this. v2.11.26's fix directly above is real
//  and still in place, but it only ever covered the ALT fire.
//
//  🌟 MEASURED, from the mod's own weapon defs (weapons\zm\):
//        microwavegundw_zm   primary, what you hold    damage 1, explosion 0/0
//        microwavegun_zm     altmode, the wave         damage 0, explosion 0/0
//  NEITHER gun kills anything with its own damage. The alt fire kills through
//  the sizzle cone (target list fixed in v2.11.26); the gun in your hands kills
//  through a damage CALLBACK, registered in init() with
//        _zm_spawner::register_zombie_damage_callback( ::microwavegun_zombie_damage_response )
//  so against a denizen every shot was landing its literal 1 point of damage.
//
//  🛑 AND A DENIZEN NEVER RUNS THAT CALLBACK. The chain that reaches it is
//        enemy_death_detection()             _zm_spawner.gsc:118, waittill "damage"
//          -> player_attacks_enemy()         :136
//          -> level.global_damage_func       = _zm_spawner::zombie_damage
//          -> check_zombie_damage_callbacks() :2025
//  and `enemy_death_detection` is threaded in exactly TWO places in the whole
//  stock dump: `zombie_spawn_init()` (_zm_spawner.gsc:236) for ordinary zombies,
//  and `_zm_ai_dogs.gsc:438` for the hellhounds. A denizen is set up by
//  `_zm_ai_screecher::screecher_prespawn` - hung on the map's own spawners at
//  _zm_ai_screecher.gsc:34 - which calls NEITHER. So NO registered damage
//  callback of any kind has ever fired for a denizen.
//
//  The fix threads the missing watcher on denizens ONLY, through the very
//  mechanism stock uses to give them their spawn function (add_spawn_function
//  on level.screecher_spawners), and routes a zap hit into the same response an
//  ordinary zombie already gets. No other AI is touched, ordinary zombies keep
//  going through stock's chain, and a denizen hit by anything else is unchanged.
//
//  📝 Spawn functions are THREADED, not called - `run_spawn_functions()`
//  (_zm_utility.gsc:283) dispatches each through single_thread() - so parking in
//  a waittill loop here cannot stall a spawn.
//
//  📝 Points: the response awards "death" points, and stock gives a denizen kill
//  NONE (screecher_death_func returns true and deletes the body, so
//  zombie_death_animscript's zombie_death_points never runs). Kept anyway,
//  because v2.11.26's sizzle half already awards them and the two halves of one
//  gun must not disagree. Say the word and both go silent.
