//  📝 THIS ONE CANNOT CAUSE A MISMATCH, unlike the fire-sale twin below, and it
//  is worth knowing why rather than assuming the two are the same shape.
//  Blood Money is `bonus_points_player`, and NEITHER side passes a

//      server  _zm_powerups.gsc:106   add_zombie_powerup( "bonus_points_player",

//  Both sides' add_zombie_powerup only reach their registerclientfield() inside
//  `if ( isdefined( client_field_name ) )`, so this powerup registers NOTHING in
//  the toplayer set on either side. The include list can therefore never fall out
//  of symmetry the way fire_sale's did in v1.54.0.
//
//  🌟 IT IS STILL ADDED, for two reasons. It keeps the two include lists identical
//  - the discipline the fire-sale bug taught - and it creates
//  level.zombie_powerups["bonus_points_player"] on the client, which is what
//  set_clientfield_code_callbacks() (_zm_powerups.csc:72-77) walks. That loop
//  reads .client_field_name and skips entries without one, so today it is inert;
//  keeping the struct present means it stays correct if that ever changes.
//
//  🛑 THE MAP GATE IS OMITTED DELIBERATELY, and the trap called out in the

//  level.zombie_include_powerups on a map whose client never populates it would

//
//  🛑 THE BUG THIS FIXES, and it was fatal, not cosmetic:
//        *****MISMATCHED CLIENTFIELDS*****
//        Clientfield powerup_fire_sale in set [toplayer] is not registered on the client
//        Server Disconnected - EXE_CLIENT_FIELD_MISMATCH
//  on TranZit (any location, reported on Diner) and Die Rise. Latent since
//  v1.54.0 shipped Fire Sale server-side with no client half; it only surfaced
//  now because those two maps had not been booted since.
//
//  🌟 WHY A ONE-LINE SERVER CHANGE NEEDED A CLIENT TWIN AT ALL. The powerup
//  clientfield is not registered by name anywhere - it is registered as a side
//  effect of a LIST. Both sides run their own add_zombie_powerup(), and both
//  open with the same gate:
//        if ( isdefined( level.zombie_include_powerups ) &&
//             !isdefined( level.zombie_include_powerups[powerup_name] ) )
//            return;
//  level.zombie_include_powerups is per-VM. Adding "fire_sale" to the SERVER's
//  list made the server register toplayer/powerup_fire_sale; the client's list
//  was untouched, so the client skipped it, and the sets came out one field
//  apart. Stock's own lists disagree the same way - zm_transit.csc:335 and
//  zm_highrise.csc:198 both omit fire_sale, matching their server halves
//  exactly. That symmetry is the thing v1.54.0 broke.
//
//  📝 Both sides register IDENTICALLY - ("toplayer", "powerup_fire_sale", 1, 2,
//  "int") - because both derive it from the same add_zombie_powerup arguments.
//  Server _zm_powerups.gsc:100 passes client_field_name "powerup_fire_sale" and
//  no clientfield_version, so both default to version 1 and 2 bits. Nothing has
//  to be kept in sync by hand beyond the map list in these two functions.
//
//  🛑 ORDERING, verified rather than assumed. Both maps' client scripts do:
//        start_zombie_stuff() { ... include_powerups();
//                                   clientscripts\mp\zombies\_zm::init(); ... }
//  and _zm.csc:63 is where _zm_powerups::init() runs. So the list must be
//  complete before _zm::init(). This main() runs before the map's - proven by
//  the animtree crash documented at the top of this file, where our
//  scriptmodelsuseanimtree() landed at client index 0 ahead of the map's - and
//  include_zombie_powerup() is purely additive (it creates the array only if
//  undefined and never clears it), so writing early cannot lose the map's own
//  entries when include_powerups() runs afterwards.
//
//  🛑 THE MAP GATE IS NOT COSMETIC. On a map whose client never calls
//  include_powerups() at all, level.zombie_include_powerups stays undefined and
//  the gate above lets EVERY powerup through. Creating the array there would
//  flip that gate and filter every powerup down to fire_sale alone. Both maps
//  named here do populate it (zm_transit.csc:335, zm_highrise.csc:198), which
//  is exactly why the list must stay these two and must match the server's.
//
//  The client's add_zombie_powerup precaches NOTHING - unlike the server's,
//  which precaches the zombie_firesale model (already shipped in
//  zone_source\mod_locations.zone). So this half needs no asset and no mod.ff

//  This is the same failure Fire Sale's twin above exists to prevent.
//
//    server _zm_powerups.gsc:101  passes client_field_name "powerup_bon_fire",

//
//  WHY EACH MAP - the full reasoning is in the server twin's block comment:
//    zm_prison  toplayer clientfield set is full - Mob classic runs at 63/63 with
//    zm_buried  this mod's additions, Buried classic is 63 stock. 63 is the only
//               total ever seen to boot. Two more bits stops the map loading.
//    zm_tomb    INCLUDED as of v2.12.1, by TRADE: the user asked for Tombstone to
//               come off Origins, which frees exactly the 2 bits this needs. The
//               removal is in perks() below and MUST stay in step with this list.
//    zm_nuked   INCLUDED as of v2.12.1. v2.12.0 excluded it on a mapents grep that
//               found no Pack-a-Punch; Nuketown builds its machines from script
//               (zm_nuked_perks.gsc:37-40), so the grep could not see it. 18 stock
//               bits - the emptiest map in the game.
//    the rest   TranZit ~54 and Die Rise ~56 once this mod's own additions are
//               counted in - real headroom on both.
//
//  📝 The client's add_zombie_powerup precaches NOTHING - unlike the server's,

//  So this half needs no asset of its own.
//
//  📝 include_powerup() belongs in main(), like Fire Sale's and Blood Money's

//
//  Ported from Origins' clientscripts\mp\zombies\_zm_powerup_zombie_blood.csc
//  rather than shipping that file, because it lives in zm_tomb_patch.ff and
//  adding a fastfile to build_ff.bat's --load list risks re-donating a shared
//  asset (the v1.62.6 blown-out-shader bug). Every function it uses is core
//  client code, so the port costs nothing - the same call already made for
//  Who's Who.
//
//  🛑 THIS MAP LIST MUST MATCH quality_of_life.gsc::zmqol_zombie_blood_enabled()
//  EXACTLY. Two clientfields are at stake - player_zombie_blood_fx (allplayers,
//  1 bit) and powerup_zombie_blood (toplayer, 2 bits, registered as a side effect
//  of add_zombie_powerup) - plus the two visionset-manager entries, whose count
//  sets visionset_slot's and overlay_slot's bit widths. Disagree on any of it and
//  every player is dropped with EXE_CLIENT_FIELD_MISMATCH before the map starts.
//
//  🛑 EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE INCLUDE RUNS IN perks_register_clientfield(), NOT
//  HERE, and each of the four reasons is a separate silent failure:
//
//    1. level.vsmgr_filter_custom_enable IS WIPED AFTER main(). _visionset_mgr.csc
//       :15 does `level.vsmgr_filter_custom_enable = []` and it is reached from
//       _zm.csc:39 - later than this script's main(). Setting our entry here
//       would be erased, the overlay would fall through to the generic branch
//       (_visionset_mgr.csc:527) and the red screen filter would never fade in.
//       No error, anywhere.
//    2. The two vsmgr_register_* calls need level.vsmgr, which does not exist
//       during main() at all - [[t6-visionset-registration-timing]], and the same
//       reason the Who's Who visionset sits in that function.
//    3. onplayerconnect_callback needs to be registered before
//       level._customplayerconnectfuncs is armed at _zm.csc:96 - which is after
//       _zm_perks::init() at :62, so that slot is comfortably early enough.
//    4. add_zombie_powerup() must land before _zm_powerups.csc::init() threads
//       set_clientfield_code_callbacks() at :63 (it walks level.zombie_powerups
//       after a 0.1s wait). :62 is before :63.
//
//  📝 include_powerup() DOES belong here in main(), like Fire Sale's and Blood
//  Money's twins above: it only writes level.zombie_include_powerups, which
//  add_zombie_powerup reads as its own gate, and writing it early cannot lose the
//  map's own entries (include_zombie_powerup is purely additive).

//  🌟 v1.99.20 - AND THE COLOUR GRADE IS APPLIED FROM HERE TOO, DIRECTLY.
//
//  v1.99.19 handed the grade back to stock's visionset manager and the screen
//  still did not go red. The server-side probe it shipped says the server half
//  is perfect:
//        [zm_qol] whoswho visionset: registered, slot_index 3, total visionsets 4
//  and the session's dvar dump says night_mode was "0" throughout, so nothing
//  was overriding the renderer either. The server picked slot 3 and the screen
//  did not change - which puts the fault in the ROUTING between the two sides.
//
//  🛑 AND THE ROUTING CAN BREAK IN COMPLETE SILENCE. I claimed last round that a
//  clean boot proves both sides registered the same visionsets, because
//  finalize_type_clientfields() derives visionset_slot's width from the count.
//  THAT INFERENCE IS WRONG and this is the counter-example:
//        getminbitcountfornum( 3 - 1 ) = 2 bits      <- client, 3 visionsets
//        getminbitcountfornum( 4 - 1 ) = 2 bits      <- server, 4 visionsets
//  Identical width, no mismatch, no error - and the server then sends slot 3 to
//  a client whose sorted list stops at index 2. get_info() returns undefined and
//  nothing is applied, forever, without a single line in any log.
//  The client can drop a registration silently too: _visionset_mgr.csc's
//  validate_info() returns false whenever version > getserverhighestclientfieldversion(),
//  and vsmgr_register_visionset_info() discards that false without a word.
//
//  THE FIX IS TO STOP DEPENDING ON THE ROUTING. visionsetnaked() applies a
//  .vision file to a local client directly - it is what the manager itself ends
//  up calling (_visionset_mgr.csc:375, and visionsetnakedlerp in
//  visionset_update_cb) - and the save/restore shape here is stock's own, from
//  clientscripts\mp\_proximity_grenade.csc:170-189:
//        saved = getvisionsetnaked( localclientnum );
//        visionsetnaked( localclientnum, "taser_mine_shock", transition );
//        ... visionsetnaked( localclientnum, saved, transition );
//  Same asset, same engine call, no slot table in between.
//
//  📝 THIS IS THE RIGHT CALLBACK TO DO IT FROM, not a convenience. Stock writes
//  clientfield_whos_who_filter and activates the visionset from the SAME four
//  consecutive lines of _zm_chugabud::activate_chugabud_effects_and_audio()
//  (:753-760), so the filter going on IS the visionset going on. They cannot

//  mystery-box vision all live on other fields and work everywhere. What Origins
//  gives up is the FX layer on the stink pile and the drops - see the server
//  file for exactly what that looks like in play.
//
//  🛑 WHY THIS IS A COPY OF init_vulture AND NOT AN EDIT OF THE REAL FILE.
//  The obvious move is to ship clientscripts\mp\zombies\_zm_perk_vulture.csc as
//  raw text (this project already does exactly that with the SERVER half, and
//  Plutonium loads raw .csc happily - the log says "loaded successfully from
//  raw"). It was tried and rejected, for a concrete reason:
//
//  the only available source for that file is a DECOMPILE, and the decompile is
//  LOSSY. Two proofs, both in BO2-Raw-files\clientscripts\mp\zombies:
//      _zm_perk_vulture.txt  _zombie_eye_glow_enable() decompiles to three
//                            assignments to n_fx_id in a row - an if/else chain
//                            whose branches were flattened, so only the last
//                            survives.
//      _zm_perks.txt         init_perk_custom_threads() decompiles to
//                            `i = 0; ...[i]...; i++;` with the loop gone.
//  It parses cleanly under gsc-tool - syntax was never the question - and it
//  would still have quietly degraded Vulture on TranZit, Die Rise and Nuketown,
//  where the perk already works, to buy it on two maps. Not a trade worth making.
//
//  So the compiled stock .csc stays exactly as it is, and only init_vulture is
//  re-implemented here. That function is the safe one to copy: it is 50 lines of
//  straight-line assignment with NO control flow at all, which is precisely the
//  shape a decompiler cannot get wrong. Every other function - including the
//  lossy ones - still runs as original bytecode.
//
//  Stock reaches init_vulture through
//      register_perk_init_thread( "specialty_nomotionsensor", ::init_vulture )
//  inside enable_vulture_perk_for_level(), which is a plain assignment to
//  level._custom_perks[perk].init_thread (_zm_perks.csc). So calling stock's
//  enable first and then re-pointing that one field swaps in this version and
//  changes nothing else. init_perk_custom_threads() later threads whatever is
//  stored there.
//
//  📝 The `::name` references below all resolve into the stock file rather than
//  this one, so they must stay fully qualified. An unqualified ::vulture_toggle
//  here would silently look for a function in zm_expanded.csc.

//  it falls apart: zm_transit authors 21 of these structs, among them FIVE
//  Speed Cola spots and THREE Pack-a-Punch spots spread over Diner, Town, Farm
//  and Cornfield. Keyed by perk name those 21 collapse to 8, and the survivor is
//  merely whichever came last - very often a machine belonging to a gametype or
//  location that never spawned. That is the reported bug: no marker on the
//  machine standing in front of you.

//  🌟 script_string IS the field that says which gametype+location a spot

//  zmqol_deadshot_perk_callback  (CLIENT)                          (v1.99.61)
//
//  🛑 THE BUG: DEADSHOT'S HEAD LOCK-ON WAS DEAD ON CONTROLLER, ON EVERY MAP.
//  Reported 2026-08-18 by the user's friend, who plays on a gamepad: the aim
//  assist pulled to the upper torso instead of the head. The user plays mouse
//  and keyboard, where Deadshot's aim assist does nothing at all, which is why
//  it survived this long unnoticed.
//
//  🌟 THE MECHANISM, READ OUT OF STOCK, NOT GUESSED. Deadshot's head snap is
//  ONE engine call made client-side: `self usealternateaimparams()`. Stock
//  makes it in exactly one place - `_zm.csc:611 player_deadshot_perk_handler`,
//  the handler on the `deadshot_perk` clientfield - and undoes it with
//  `clearalternateaimparams()`.
//
//  🛑 AND THIS MOD HAD DELETED THAT CLIENTFIELD EVERYWHERE. init_client_flags()
//  in quality_of_life.gsc and init_client_flag_callback_funcs() here both set
//  `level.disable_deadshot_clientfield = 1` unconditionally. STOCK SETS IT ON
//  BURIED ALONE (zm_buried.gsc:222 / zm_buried.csc:40), where there is no
//  Deadshot machine, to free a bit. Set globally it is symmetric, so nothing
//  ever errored - the field simply never registered, the handler never ran, and
//  the perk shipped with its headline effect missing on every map.
//
//  🌟 WHY THE FIX DOES NOT PUT THE FIELD BACK. Restoring `deadshot_perk` costs
//  one `toplayer` bit on every map, and Mob of the Dead's toplayer set is the
//  tightest this mod touches (checkpoint 17 and v1.65.2 both had to free bits
//  there, and its true headroom has never been measured). Spending a bit on a
//  second field is unnecessary, because a field carrying exactly the same
//  information is ALREADY registered and already paid for:
//
//      perk_dead_shot   <- _zm_perks.gsc:2224, set_perk_clientfield()
//
//  set_perk_clientfield( "specialty_deadshot", 1 ) runs from give_perk() and
//  ( ..., 0 ) from perk_think()'s take path - the SAME two functions that used
//  to drive deadshot_perk, in the same frames. So the trigger points are
//  identical and this costs nothing.
//
//  📝 It also fixes BURIED, which stock never could: the mod adds Deadshot
//  there and stock's own wiring is switched off on that map by design.
//
//  The body below is `player_deadshot_perk_handler` verbatim, guard included -
//  the guard matters, because a toplayer field also fires on spectated players.
//  The chain to level.zombies_global_perk_client_callback keeps Vulture Aid's
//  machine-hiding fx working: that is what this row's callback used to be, and
//  it is read at CALL time rather than captured at registration, so it does not

	//  🛑 v1.99.0 - THE RISER SOUND. THIS IS A PROBE AS WELL AS A FIX, and it
	//  is deliberately BOTH because three rounds of theorising did not settle
	//  it and the user has now reported it silent twice.
	//
	//  What is meant to happen: the server sets this clientfield in
	//  _zm_spawner::zombie_rise_burst_fx, and stock's
	//  _zm.csc::handle_zombie_risers plays "zmb_zombie_spawn" and the dirt
	//  burst/billow fx. ONE trigger drives both halves.
	//
	//  What has been RULED OUT, each measured (see QUEUE.md B-RISERSND):
	//    - the audio is unreachable   ❌ zmb_common.all.sabl, which owns the
	//      dirt_00/dirt_01 payloads, loads at frontend start (console_zm.log:363)
	//      and the alias is defined in zmb_survival_transit.all.
	//    - the mod permutes the actor clientfield order ❌ stock registers
	//      zombie_riser_fx first server-side (_zm.gsc:1161) and THIRD
	//      client-side (_zm.csc:419); this file mirrors stock exactly.
	//    - the mod touches the riser path anywhere else ❌ grepped scripts/,
	//      maps/ and clientscripts/.
	//
	//  So the remaining question is simply WHETHER THE HANDLER RUNS AT ALL, and
	//  the only way left to answer it is from inside the handler. This wrapper
	//  prints one line the first time it fires and then calls stock's handler
	//  unchanged - so if the log shows the line, the trigger works and the
	//  fault is in audio; if it never appears, the clientfield is not arriving
	//  and the spawner path is where to look next.
	//
	//  It also plays the alias itself, which is the fix IF the cause is that
	//  stock's own playsound is being lost. Harmless if not: a second playsound
	//  of the same one-shot alias at the same origin is at worst inaudible
	//  doubling, and a missing alias is silent rather than an error.
	//
	//  🛑 ONE PRINT PER MATCH, NOT PER ZOMBIE. level.zmqol_riser_logged gates
	//  it; at round 10 this fires dozens of times a minute and an unbounded
	//  println is its own problem.

//    the actor origin is valid            -> 513 units from the player, v1.99.5 probe
//    "zmb_zombie_spawn" is defined        -> 2 rows in zmb_survival_transit.all, LOADED
//    the alias row is ordinary            -> vol 86, probability 1, 3d, DistMin 250 /
//                                            DistMaxDry 1000, bus_hdrfx like 3,130 others
//    its payload is present               -> hashes AAF96C0F / 77818910 found in
//                                            zmb_common.all.SABL (the loaded bank the
//                                            alias's Storage=loaded demands), and NOT in
//                                            the .sabs. That bank loads at console_zm.log:349
//    mod.all does not shadow it           -> 0 rows in the BUILT 2,280-row alias table
//    the sound is played TWICE            -> ours, then stock's
//
//  ...and it is still inaudible. The one question no file can answer is whether
//  the alias produces audio AT ALL when played point blank. This answers it.
//
//  HOW TO USE - either route, they end at the same dvar:
//      console :  zmqol_testsound zmb_zombie_spawn
//      chat    :  .testsound zmb_zombie_spawn        (or bare .testsound)
//
//  It plays THREE things, spaced, and prints each one:
//      1/3  2D          playsound( 0, alias )            - no distance model at all
//      2/3  3D          playsound( 0, alias, player )    - at your own feet, distance 0
//      3/3  CONTROL     zmb_powerup_grabbed at the player
//
//  🌟 THE CONTROL IS NOT ARBITRARY. zmb_powerup_grabbed sits in the SAME alias
//  bank, on the SAME bus (bus_hdrfx), with the SAME Storage (loaded) and the SAME
//  DistMin (250), and its payload is in the SAME .sabl (zmb_common.all). It is
//  the closest matched pair in the game, and the user hears it every match.
//
//  READING THE RESULT:
//      all three audible      -> the alias is fine; the fault is the riser wiring
//                                or its timing, not the audio asset
//      control only           -> this alias produces no audio, full stop
//      2D yes, 3D no          -> positional attenuation, not the asset
//      nothing at all         -> the probe never reached audio; say so, do not
//                                read it as "the alias is dead"
//
//  🛑 COSTS NOTHING WHEN UNUSED. One getdvar every 0.25s on the client, which is

//  User, 2026-08-20, screenshot: *"I gave myself only Vulture Aid using the chat

//  the screenshot didn't disappear after purchasing the perk, but Deadshot
//  Daiquiri did lose the icon as intended like regular perks do, so just make
//  sure that when you buy perks from the perk machines they lose their icons
//  same with the weapons white and blue icon for the machines that didn't have
//  Vulture Aid icons to start with."*
//
//  -- THE CAUSE ---------------------------------------------------------------
//  zmqol_vulture_machine_should_show() already refuses to draw a marker for a
//  perk the local player owns, and every perk this mod can mark is mapped to its
//  specialty in zmqol_vulture_marker_perk() - PhD included (code 12 ->
//  specialty_flakjacket). The filter is simply never RE-RUN: it is evaluated
//  inside zmqol_vulture_machines_enable(), which only runs when a marker's
//  clientfield changes, when Vulture vision is toggled, or when the height dvar
//  moves. Buy a perk with the markers already up and nothing re-evaluates them,
//  so the icon stays lit until something else happens to rebuild the set.
//
//  Deadshot looked like it worked for exactly one reason: stock's own
//  vulture_global_perk_client_callback registers a callback on perk_dead_shot
//  (_zm_perk_vulture.csc:783) which tears down ITS marker - a path that never
//  existed for the perks Treyarch never drew.
//
//  -- THE FIX -----------------------------------------------------------------
//  Watch the local player's owned-perk set and rebuild when it changes. That is
//  perk-agnostic on purpose: it fixes PhD, the three skull machines (Tombstone /
//  Electric Cherry / Who's Who) and anything added later, without depending on
//  which perks stock happens to hook.
//
//  Cost: one pass a second, and only while a local client is actually holding
//  Vulture Aid - level.perk_vulture.fx_array is only populated then, which is
//  the same guard chain the height watcher uses. Each pass is a dozen hasperk()
//  calls and, in the steady state, nothing else: the rebuild only fires when the
//  signature string actually differs.
//
//  zmqol_vulture_machines_enable() clears the previous set before drawing (its

//  stack duplicate fx.

//  *"the icons for the perks that have default/weapon icons on them for vulture
//  aid dont disappear after you have the perk, make sure that once a perk is
//  obtained the icon disppears."*
//
//  🌟 WHY THE EVENT ROUTE CANNOT COVER THESE PERKS - MEASURED, NOT INFERRED.
//  zmqol_vulture_global_perk_callback() only runs for perks whose clientfield
//  was registered WITH a callback. Reading the registrations rather than
//  assuming them:
//      perk_dead_shot        ::zmqol_deadshot_perk_callback  -> chains  ✅
//      the eight in perks_register_clientfield()             -> chains  ✅
//      perk_dive_to_nuke     stock _zm_perk_divetonuke.csc:22 registers it with
//                            the callback argument literally `undefined`   ❌
//  So PhD Flopper has NO client callback at all, on any map, in stock or here -
//  which is exactly the perk the user named both times. Stock's own
//  register_perk_with_clientfield( "perk_dive_to_nuke", "specialty_flakjacket" )
//  is dead code for that reason.
//
//  🛑 SO THE POLL IS THE ONLY COVER FOR IT, AND THE POLL WAS NOT RUNNING.
//  v1.99.91 gated every pass on FOUR stock fields -
//  level.perk_vulture.fx_array, .fx_array[c], .fx_array[c].player_ent and
//  .players_with_vulture_perk[c] - none of which this mod writes, and fx_array
//  is never initialised anywhere in stock's file (only ever indexed into, at
//  _zm_perk_vulture.csc:689). Any one of them being other than assumed silently
//  disables the whole thing, with no error, which is what shipped.
//
//  🌟 THE FIX IS TO STOP ASKING STOCK. level.zmqol_vulture_fx[c] is written by
//  zmqol_vulture_machines_enable() and cleared by _disable(), so "is it defined"
//  IS the question this watch actually wants - markers are up for that client
//  right now - and it carries .player_ent as of this version. No stock struct is
//  in the chain any more, so this cannot be switched off by a field being
//  shaped differently than expected.
//
//  📝 Rebuilding is safe to do from here: zmqol_vulture_machines_enable() calls
//  _disable() first, so a rebuild replaces the set rather than stacking on it.

//  That is CORE zombies client code and runs on all six maps. Without a handler
//  the gun charges in complete silence - no error, nothing in the log, exactly
//  the "a missing sound is silent, never an error" class.
//
//  🛑 AND ORIGINS ALREADY OWNS THAT POINTER. zm_tomb_amb.csc:210 sets
//  level.sndchargeshot_func = ::sndchargeshot for the four elemental staffs, and
//  its handler DEFAULTS to the fire staff for any weapon it does not recognise:
//
//      alias = "wpn_firestaff_charge_";
//      if ( weaponname == "staff_water_upgraded_zm" ) ...
//
//  So clobbering the pointer would kill all four staff charge sounds, and simply
//  leaving Origins alone would make the Storm PSR play the FIRE STAFF's charge
//  whine there. Both are regressions. This chains instead: metalstorm is handled
//  here, everything else is passed to whatever was installed first - which is
//  stock's own handler on Origins and nothing at all on the other five maps.
//
//  🛑 INSTALLED ON A THREAD, NOT IN main(). The mod's root scripts run BEFORE the
//  map's on both sides (see the animtree note at the top of this file), so a
//  pointer written in main() is simply overwritten when zm_tomb_amb.csc runs.
//  This waits for the map to install its own first, then wraps it.
//
//  📝 The aliases are the CAMPAIGN's own - wpn_metalstormsnp_charge_loop and
//  wpn_metalstormsnp_charge_plr_1..5 - and this mod declares none of them. They
//  come from the soundbank asset mod.ff now carries, and all 35 of that bank's
//  audio payloads already live in cmn_root.all.sabl, which loads on every map.
//  Verified 2026-09-06 by hashing every FileSource with the engine's own snd_id:
//  35/35 present, in retail's cmn_root AND in the user's custom sound pack.
