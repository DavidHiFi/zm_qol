//  zm_qol: THE DINER BUILDABLE RIOT SHIELD                         (v1.66.0)
//
//  User, 2026-08-11: *"add the buildable shield to diner, it already exists in
//  the tranzit map, just remove the tarp on the buildable table in the building
//  and add the 2 parts spawns just like the regular tranzit."*
//
//  It is more than the tarp, and every claim below is read out of the shipped
//  map or the stock scripts, not assumed.
//
//  WHAT SURVIVAL ALREADY HAS (Unlinker --include-assets mapents zm_transit.ff):
//    * all 3 dolly structs `riotshield_zm_t6_wpn_zmb_shield_dolly` at
//      (-6118.7,-7869.1,0) (-6467,-7727,0) (-5768.9,-7872.6,1.4)
//    * all 3 door structs `riotshield_zm_t6_wpn_zmb_shield_door` at
//      (-4486,-7980,-8.5) (-4995,-7824,-42) (-4404.5,-7740.5,-1.4)
//      Neither carries script_gameobjectname, so the gamemode filter never
//      touches them - the parts have been sitting there the whole time. And
//      generate_zombie_buildable_piece() looks them up by exactly
//      `buildablename + "_" + modelname`, which is those targetnames.
//    * the riot shield WEAPON and its equipment handling: zm_transit.gsc:314
//      calls include_equipment_for_level() from main() with NO gamemode gate,
//      and that includes "riotshield_zm" (:1630). Core _zm_equipment::init()
//      runs from _zm.gsc:154 on every map and mode.
//
//  WHAT IT DOES NOT HAVE, and why:
//    1. zm_transit_buildables::include_buildables() / ::init_buildables() are
//       called from zm_transit_classic.gsc:33-34 and NOWHERE ELSE, so in
//       survival no riotshield buildable is defined at all.
//    2. The bench trigger `riotshield_zm_buildable_trigger` and the shield on
//       the table `buildable_riotshield` both carry
//       script_gameobjectname "zclassic", and _zm_gametype.gsc:110
//       game_objects_allowed() calls entity delete() on a mismatch. Handled in
//       zm_transit_loc_diner.gsc, which runs early enough - see there.
//
//  🛑 ONLY THE SHIELD IS REGISTERED, not stock's include_buildables(). That
//  would drag in the jetgun, turbine, turret, electric trap, power switch and
//  the buildable Pack-a-Punch, whose triggers are all zclassic-deleted here -
//  parts with nowhere to go.
//
//  WHY level.init_buildables AND NOT A DIRECT CALL. Core
//  _zm_buildables::init() (_zm.gsc:153) does the resets - buildable_piece_count
//  0, buildable_stubs [], buildablepickups [] - and THEN calls
//  [[ level.init_buildables ]](). Registering before that point would have the
//  resets wipe it. Nothing in the 2,093-file stock dump ever ASSIGNS that
//  pointer, only reads it, so it is free to take. It is also the exact hook the
//  client half uses, which keeps the two sides shaped the same.
//
//  🛑 MAP-SCOPED ON PURPOSE. This references maps\mp\zm_transit_buildables,
//  which resolves at SCRIPT LOAD time. It therefore cannot live in
//  scripts\zm\locs\zm_transit_loc_diner.gsc - not one file under locs\ carries
//  a maps\mp\zm_* reference, deliberately - nor in quality_of_life.gsc.
//  AI_CONTEXT rule 2: a map-specific reference in a globally-loaded script
//  throws "Unresolved external" on every OTHER map, and a runtime guard does
//  not save it.

//  JET GUN IN A REAL WEAPON SLOT                                    (v2.9.9)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User directive 2026-08-30 (task 3): move the jet gun out of the equipment
//  slot into a standard weapon slot, never breaks, keep the heat mechanic.
//
//  WHAT "EQUIPMENT SLOT" ACTUALLY IS, measured: the jet gun's def is
//  inventoryType "item", and _zm_equipment::equipment_give() adds the
//  bookkeeping - set_player_equipment, the one-equipment-at-a-time
//  equipment_take() (which is why claiming the jet gun costs you your shield
//  and building a shield costs you the jet gun), clip forced to 1, and the
//  drop/placed-item lifecycle.
//
//  THE CHANGE, in three coordinated pieces:
//    1. weapons\zm\jetgun_zm / jetgun_upgraded_zm: inventoryType item ->
//       primary, now UNDER the 20,480 raw-loader ceiling (they were over it
//       and never loaded - ERROR_CATALOGUE §36; that also means the v1.99.23
//       Paralyzer-cooldown fields in them have never applied either, and both
//       land together the first time the trimmed defs load).
//    2. The crafting-table claim: level.zombie_include_buildables["jetgun_zm"]
//       .onbought - stock's own per-buildable hook (_zm_buildables.gsc:2140),
//       which REPLACES the whole equipment_buy branch when set. The claim now
//       gives the gun as a normal weapon: full clip, no equipment bookkeeping,
//       so the shield and the jet gun coexist.
//    3. Every other give route: the equipment_give replaceFunc in main().
//
//  WHAT IS DELIBERATELY UNTOUCHED, because it keys on the unchanged name
//  "jetgun_zm": watch_overheat / wait_for_jetgun_fired / the whole firing,
//  drag, gib and grind logic, and every client-side fx in _zm_weap_jetgun.csc
//  (all of it tests currentweapon == "jetgun_zm" - a renamed weapon would have
//  lost the vortex and power-cell effects, which is why no qol-copy def is
//  used here).
//
//  NEVER BREAKS is already live (v1.99.23, the three flags above). Heat is the
//  def's own engine mechanic (overheatWeapon 1) and survives untouched.
//
//  🛑 HONEST GATE, stated: whether a raw weapons\zm\ def OVERRIDES the copy
//  zm_transit.ff supplies is still unproven (the DSR 50 in v2.9.8 is the same
//  experiment). If the map's def wins, inventoryType stays "item": the gun
//  then still never breaks, still keeps its heat, and still coexists with the
//  shield (that half is pure script), but it selects via the D-pad slot the
//  way stock did instead of cycling with your guns. The claim path below works
//  identically under either outcome - giveweapon + setactionslot behave for
//  both inventory types.

//  zmqol_jetgun_give_as_primary  -  THE JET GUN MUST COST A WEAPON SLOT
//
//  ✅ VERIFIED IN GAME 2026-09-04 (v2.11.14, TranZit) - user: "the jetgun works
//  as intended, now replaces an actual weapon slot". The raw-def half stays as
//  measured; this function is what makes the slot cost real.
//
//  🛑 User, 2026-09-04, TranZit: "i had the jet gun, whilst having mule kick
//  and three guns, but the jet gun wasn't actually overriding a real weapon
//  slot, so i ended up having 4 weapons".
//
//  MEASURED CAUSE, and it is NOT the def. The def half has been right since
//  v2.9.11 - the raw weapons\zm\jetgun_zm loads as inventoryType "primary",
//  measured in the running game. What was missing is that both of this file's
//  give paths called the bare engine builtin `giveweapon`, and NOTHING IN THE
//  ENGINE ENFORCES THE PRIMARY LIMIT. T6 enforces it in SCRIPT, inside
//  _zm_weapons::weapon_give: it reads getweaponslistprimaries() (:2333),
//  compares against get_player_weapon_limit( player ) (:2341 - 2, or
//  level.additionalprimaryweapon_limit with Mule Kick, _zm_utility.gsc:5046)
//  and takes the HELD weapon first when the player is already at the cap
//  (:2406-2425). A bare giveweapon skips every one of those steps, so a full
//  loadout simply gained a fourth gun.
//
//  🛑 WHY NOT SIMPLY CALL weapon_give( "jetgun_zm" ) AND BE DONE. Because
//  TranZit registers the jet gun as equipment - register_equipment_for_level(
//  "jetgun_zm" ), zm_transit.gsc:1854 - so weapon_give's own first act,
//  `if ( is_equipment( weapon ) ) equipment_give( weapon )` (:2343), lands in
//  zmqol_equipment_give() below, gives the gun there, and weapon_give then sees
//  hasweapon() and returns at :2352 having never reached the limit block. The
//  call would look correct and change nothing. So the limit block is reproduced
//  here, in stock's order, and BOTH give paths go through this one function.
//
//  📝 The equipment registration is deliberately left alone: _zm_weap_jetgun
//  and its client twin key on the name "jetgun_zm" throughout, and stock's
//  is_equipment() guard below is what keeps the riot shield from being taken
//  when it is the weapon in hand.
// ============================================================================
// ============================================================================
//  zmqol_weapon_give  -  THE JET GUN CAN BE SWAPPED OUT LIKE ANY GUN (v2.11.26)
// ============================================================================
//  User, 2026-09-04, TranZit: *"i managed to end up with 4 guns again … i had it
//  in my hands, already had 3 weapons with mule kick, then with chat commands
//  gave myself a new weapon and it didn't overwrite the jet gun's weapon slot
//  and instead added it to a 4th one … no more having 4 weapons due to the jet
//  gun not properly working as a weapon slot."*
//
//  🛑 v2.11.14 FIXED THE OTHER DIRECTION ONLY. Giving the JET GUN at the cap
//  takes a real weapon (zmqol_jetgun_give_as_primary, confirmed in game). This
//  is the reverse: giving ANY OTHER weapon while the jet gun is the weapon in
//  hand. Stock's own limit block, _zm_weapons.gsc:2407-2426, reads
//
//      if ( primaryweapons.size >= weapon_limit )
//      {
//          if ( is_placeable_mine( current_weapon ) || is_equipment( current_weapon ) )
//              current_weapon = undefined;      <-- nothing is taken
//
//  and TranZit registers the jet gun as equipment - register_equipment_for_level(
//  "jetgun_zm" ), zm_transit.gsc:1854 - so the gun in your hands was exempt from
//  being taken and the new one simply became a fourth. The exclusion is there to
//  stop a RIOT SHIELD or a placed mine being taken; the jet gun is a genuine
//  primary here (raw weapons\zm\ def, inventoryType "primary", measured in the
//  running game) and does hold a slot, so it must not be exempt.
//
//  🛑 WHY THE WHOLE FUNCTION IS COPIED RATHER THAN A UTILITY HOOKED. The obvious
//  smaller fix is to replace _zm_utility::is_equipment so it answers "no" for the
//  jet gun. Every one of its nine stock callers was read, and three of them
//  change behaviour that nobody asked for: can_track_ammo (_zm.gsc:631),
//  has_weapon_or_upgrade (_zm_weapons.gsc:1896), and - the one that settles it -
//  zombie_death_points (_zm_spawner.gsc:1651), which withholds points for an
//  EQUIPMENT kill. Flipping that would silently make the jet gun a points weapon.
//  So the change is made in the one place it belongs instead.
//
//  🌟 THE BLAST RADIUS IS AS SMALL AS IT CAN BE MADE:
//    - the replaceFunc is in this MAP'S main(), so no other map runs a line of it;
//    - the body is _zm_weapons::weapon_give copied from the stock dump with every
//      call QUALIFIED (so a replaced utility - is_offhand_weapon, replaced by
//      bouncingbetty.gsc - still reaches the mod's version, exactly as stock did);
//    - exactly ONE condition differs from stock, and it is gated on the weapon
//      name AND on the def actually being a primary at runtime, so every other
//      weapon in the game takes byte-identical decisions.
//
//  📝 If the raw def ever fails the 20,480 B loader ceiling (ERROR_CATALOGUE
//  36) the map's own "item" def is back, the jet gun costs no slot, and
//  zmqol_jetgun_holds_a_slot() answers 0 - stock's exclusion applies again and
//  the player does not lose a gun for nothing. Checked at runtime, not assumed.
// ============================================================================

// ============================================================================
//  JET GUN - IT NEVER BREAKS, AND IT COOLS LIKE THE PARALYZER   (v1.99.23)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User, 2026-08-17: the jet gun should stop being "the terrible piece of trash
//  it is in the stock game" - never break, so it never needs rebuilding, and to
//  pay for that, take the Paralyzer's cooldown so it cannot be fired forever.
//
//  🛑 THIS IS HALF THE REQUEST. The other half - making it occupy a real weapon
//  slot instead of the equipment slot - is queue 16 and is NOT done here. It
//  needs `inventoryType` flipped in the weapon def, which reroutes how the gun
//  is given, dropped and picked up, and that is a bigger change than this one.
//  Split deliberately: this half is self-contained and its result tells us
//  whether the other half is even deliverable. See the probe note below.
//
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  NEVER BREAKS - one flag, and it is stock's own
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  `maps\mp\zm_transit.gsc:1638` sets `level.explode_overheated_jetgun = 1`.
//  That is the ONLY assignment to it in the whole game, and its two siblings
//  `unbuild_overheated_jetgun` / `take_overheated_jetgun` are set nowhere at
//  all. `_zm_weap_jetgun.gsc:201 handle_overheated_jetgun()` tests all three
//  with `isdefined( x ) && x` and, with none of them true, does NOTHING - the
//  gun simply overheats and cools down. So clearing the flag is the entire
//  "never breaks" feature; nothing is reimplemented and no stock function is
//  replaced.
//
//  Set to 0 rather than undefined on purpose: the stock test is
//  `isdefined( x ) && x`, so 0 satisfies it either way, and a defined 0 cannot
//  be mistaken later for "this was never set".
//
//  🛑 Cleared AFTER `flag_wait( "start_zombie_round_logic" )` because line 1638
//  runs during the map's own init and would otherwise set it back. Same
//  ordering trick, and the same flag, that `qol_options.gsc:914` already uses.
//
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  THE COOLDOWN - three numbers, measured, not tuned by feel
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Both guns already use the SAME engine overheat system (`overheatWeapon 1`,
//  driven by setweaponoverheating / isweaponoverheating). `_zm_weap_slowgun.gsc`
//  is 815 lines and has no heat, cooldown or fuel logic anywhere in it - the
//  Paralyzer's bar is entirely its weapon file. So this is not a port; it is
//  three fields, taken by dumping both defs with the Unlinker and diffing all
//  1,027 fields of each by value:
//
//      overheatRate     17 -> 10   heats up slower
//      cooldownRate      1 ->  3   cools three times faster
//      overheatEndVal   77 -> 87   the threshold the overheat lockout releases at
//
//  📝 The first two are unambiguous. `overheatEndVal` is NOT described anywhere
//  in this workspace and its direction is UNVERIFIED - whether a higher value
//  releases the lockout sooner or later is a guess either way, so no claim is
//  made about it. It is set to the Paralyzer's value because copying the
//  Paralyzer's feel is the request; the number is measured, its meaning is not.
//
//  They ship in `weapons\zm\jetgun_zm` and `weapons\zm\jetgun_upgraded_zm`,
//  which are byte-for-byte the stock defs with exactly those 3 of 1,027 fields
//  changed. The upgraded def is included because if anything in this mod ever
//  Pack-a-Punches the jet gun, an untouched upgraded def would silently hand
//  back the stock cooldown mid-game.
//
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  🔮 WHAT THIS IS ALSO A PROBE FOR
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Raw weapon defs in `weapons\zm\` are a proven path here - 40 ride there now
//  (thundergun, tesla, freezegun, the MP weapons, Tac-45) and they work. BUT
//  every one of those 40 is a weapon that exists in NO zombies fastfile, so
//  they only prove a raw def can SUPPLY a missing weapon. `jetgun_zm` already
//  exists inside `zm_transit.ff`, so this is the first time a raw def has to
//  OVERRIDE one. That cannot be settled offline.
//
//  **If the cooldown feels different in game, the raw def overrode the fastfile**
//  - and queue 16 becomes deliverable the same way. If it feels identical, the
//  fastfile copy is still in charge and 16 needs a different route entirely.
//  The inventorytype line below is the baseline for that comparison: it must
//  read `item` today, and would read `primary` once 16 lands.

//  for bus depot survival."
//
//  WHAT THE STOCK MAP PUTS THERE - read out of the zm_transit mapents dump
//  (T6-Data-Archive zm_transit.d3dbsp), not assumed:
//
//      info_volume              depot_lava_pit / lava_volume  (-6698, 4771, -101)
//      trigger_multiple         lava_damage / fire            (-6698, 4771,  -95)
//      info_vehicle_node_rotate BUS_START / depot             (-6527, 4770, -28.6)
//
//  so the pit is exactly the spot the bus first pulls away from, as described.
//  Bus Depot survival then dresses FOUR "game_mode_object" structs over it.
//  _zm_gametype::setup_standard_objects( "station" ) spawns each one as a plain
//  script_model AT its struct origin, so these are the map's own numbers:
//
//      veh_t6_civ_smallwagon_dead     (-6663.96, 4816.34, -71.8)   <- "the car"
//      veh_t6_civ_microbus_dead       (-6807.05, 4765.23, -68.01)
//      veh_t6_civ_movingtrk_cab_dead  (-6652.9,  4767.7,   -6.73)
//      p6_zm_rocks_small_cluster_01   (-6745.48, 4782.86, -79.01)
//
//  The map has NINE station barricades; the other five stand at the play-area
//  edge (x -7900..-8100 and -5787) and are deliberately left alone.
//
//  🛑 DELETING THE PROPS ALONE WOULD NOT OPEN ANYTHING. The pit itself is
//  plugged by the collision model handed in here - zm_collision_transit_
//  busdepot_survival, spawned by stock's own station main() three lines above
//  the call. Reimagined deletes it too, in scripts\zm\zm_transit\
//  zm_transit_reimagined.gsc::busdepot_remove_lava_collision(), whose own
//  comment says the pit plug and the play-area edge collision are the SAME
//  entity - which is why it then spawns three replacement walls at the edge.
//  Both halves are ported: the deletion without the walls would open the map
//  edge, which is a regression, not a feature.
//
//  ⚠️ ONE THING COULD NOT BE MEASURED OFFLINE, and is stated rather than
//  hidden: what that collision model actually covers. OAT dumps all four
//  zm_collision_transit_*_survival models as the identical 8-vertex 512-unit
//  cube (they plainly cannot all be one cube), so the real collision lives in
//  data the Unlinker does not export. Reimagined's shipped, played behaviour is
//  the only evidence there is, and the three wall positions below are its
//  numbers verbatim.
//
//  📝 NO connectpaths() BEFORE THE DELETE, on purpose - Reimagined does not
//  call one either. The nodes stock disconnected are the ones over the plug;
//  with the pit open again they SHOULD stay disabled, exactly as in classic.
//
//  📝 SURVIVAL ONLY. This runs from main_o(), which replaces
//  maps\mp\zm_transit_standard_station::main - registered for "transit" on
//  zstandard alone. Grief's Bus Depot goes through zm_transit_grief_station and
//  is untouched; the four props do not exist there anyway, their script_string
//  being "zstandard znml zcleansed".
//
//  📝 collision_wall_512x512x10_standard NEEDS NO PRECACHE HERE. Stock
//  zm_transit.gsc:203 threads zm_transit_ffotd::main_start() as the FIRST
//  statement of the map's own main(), and that precaches it unconditionally,
//  long before any location main runs.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  User, 2026-08-28: a PATCHES-tab toggle for Classic TranZit and all four
//  survival locations (Diner, Farm, Town, Bus Depot) that leaves lava visible
//  on the ground but stops it igniting/exploding zombies and stops it
//  damaging players. Dvar: no_lava_damage (qol_options.gsc).
//
//  WHY lava_damage_init IS THE HOOK, NOT THE DAMAGE FUNCTIONS THEMSELVES.
//  Stock's maps\mp\zm_transit_lava.gsc:
//      lava_damage_init()   -> array_thread( lava, ::lava_damage_think )
//      lava_damage_think()  -> ent thread player_lava_damage( self )
//                              ent thread zombie_lava_damage( self )
//  Both dispatch calls are UNQUALIFIED, SAME FILE - a replaceFunc aimed at
//  player_lava_damage/zombie_lava_damage from an external script like this one
//  cannot intercept them (AI_CONTEXT rule 3 / starter kit CLAUDE.md §4, failure
//  mode 1). lava_damage_init() is different: BOTH its stock callers
//  (zm_transit.gsc and zm_transit_dr.gsc, Diner's own top-level script) invoke
//  it as `level thread maps\mp\zm_transit_lava::lava_damage_init()` - a
//  qualified call from a DIFFERENT file, which is exactly the case replaceFunc
//  is built for.
//
//  🛑 NO "CALL THE ORIGINAL" AFTER A REPLACE. Once lava_damage_init is
//  replaced, any call to that qualified name - including from inside this very
//  replacement - redirects back here, so qol_lava_damage_init() below
//  reimplements stock's six-line body directly rather than trying to invoke a
//  now-shadowed original. qol_lava_damage_think() is a line-for-line copy of
//  stock's lava_damage_think(), with exactly two differences: one inserted
//  live dvar check, and its two dispatch calls made BY QUALIFIED NAME to
//  stock's real, untouched player_lava_damage()/zombie_lava_damage() - calling
//  a function externally by its qualified name is unaffected by replacing a
//  DIFFERENT function in the same file, so OFF/vanilla reproduces stock
//  exactly. Neither damage function nor any of their own helpers
//  (zombie_burning_fx, zombie_burning_dmg, player_stop_burning, etc.) are
//  touched at all - when the toggle is OFF they simply never get a reason not
//  to run, and when it is ON they are never reached in the first place.

// ============================================================================
//  zmqol_no_power_transit_extras  -  NO POWER NEEDED's TranZit half (v2.11.22)
// ============================================================================
//  The root row (qol_options.gsc) runs stock's turn_power_on_and_open_doors(),
//  which covers the flag, the client sync and every door. TranZit needs one
//  more thing that no other map has: a SECOND flag.
//
//  zm_transit_power.gsc's electricswitch() sets "switches_on" BEFORE "power_on"
//  (:63 then :68) and three separate systems read it on its own:
//      powerevent()              :395  the reactor core rise - the thing that
//                                      makes the power station look powered
//      _zm_ai_avogadro.gsc      :1295  needs power_on AND switches_on together
//      zm_transit_sq.gsc   :962/:994/  four side-quest gates, each testing both
//                    :1037/:1118
//  Leaving it clear meant the map had power while every system that asks the
//  second question still believed it did not.
//
//  🛑 flag_exists() FIRST, ALWAYS. "switches_on" is flag_init()'d inside
//  zm_transit_power.gsc:43, so it exists only once that script has run - and
//  flag_set() on an uninitialised flag asserts. This file is TranZit-only so
//  the flag will be there, but the guard costs nothing and the failure it
//  prevents is a load-time assert.
//
//  Setting it AFTER power_on rather than before is deliberate and harmless:
//  powerevent() is already threaded (zm_transit_power.gsc:16), so it picks the
//  flag up and plays the full 30-second reactor sequence exactly as it would
//  have; nothing waits on "power_event_complete" except the switch's own loop,
//  which is parked on its trigger.
// ============================================================================
//  🌟 v2.11.24 - A LOOP, BECAUSE THE ROW IS A TOGGLE NOW.
//
//  Clearing "switches_on" is stock's own way down: zm_transit_power.gsc:90 does
//  exactly this when a player flips the real switch back off, and powerevent()
//  (:382) is a two-way loop parked on flag_waitopen( "switches_on" ) - so the
//  clear plays the full 30-second reactor-lowering sequence, doors and all,
//  with no help from this file.
//
//  📝 STOCK CLEARS "switches_on" FIRST AND "power_on" 30 SECONDS LATER, after
//  "power_event_complete". This row clears power_on immediately (in
//  qol_options.gsc) and the two run concurrently instead: a cheat row that took
//  30 seconds to go off would read as broken. The only visible difference is
//  that the lights die before the reactor finishes sinking. Nothing waits on
//  that ordering - _zm_ai_avogadro and the four zm_transit_sq gates test both
//  flags and see both clear either way.
