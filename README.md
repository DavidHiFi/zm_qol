# Quality Of Life

**An extensive overhaul mod for Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Zombies on [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw).**

Almost all Campaign weapons and every single Multiplayer weapon in the Mystery Box, 4 wonder weapons ported straight from the unreleased DLC5, bonus Survival maps, and a user-friendly Settings menu that you can configure to your heart's content in-game.

## Installation

Install Plutonium and run it once so its folders exist, then close it.

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/DavidHiFi/T6-QoL/releases/latest) and unzip it anywhere.
2. Run **`Windows Install.bat`**.
3. Choose **INSTALL → The mod** and confirm.
4. Launch Plutonium T6 → **Zombies → Mods → Quality Of Life**.

Arrow keys to move, **Enter** to choose, **Q** to quit. No admin rights, nothing left running, and no game file is touched — everything goes inside Plutonium's own folder. The installer can also fetch the optional extras: the HD texture and custom sound packs, controller icons, ReShade, backups, and a full uninstaller.

**Start menu shortcuts** are one of its options — pick it and you can reach **Quality Of Life Mod** (this installer) and **Plutonium ReShade Watcher** by pressing the Windows key and typing. They point at the folder you unzipped to, so keep it somewhere you're happy to leave it; the uninstall list removes them again.

### Standalone downloads

Neither needs the mod installed:

| Download | Size | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| [**HD Texture Pack**](https://github.com/DavidHiFi/T6-QoL/releases/latest/download/HD.Texture.Pack.zip) | 525 MB | Higher-resolution textures, animated Pack-a-Punch camo, and much more. Unzip and drop the `images` folder into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plutonium\storage\t6\`. |
| [**Controller Icons**](https://github.com/DavidHiFi/T6-QoL/releases/latest/download/Controller.Icons.Pack.zip) | 184 KB | PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One button prompts. Pick one of the three folders inside and copy the `.iwi` files into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plutonium\storage\t6\images\`. |

<details>
<summary><b>Install the mod by hand (Windows and Linux)</b></summary>

<br>

On **Linux** (Wine, Proton, Lutris, Bottles) there is no automated installer — install by hand; it works like any other Plutonium mod.

1. Download the release zip and open the **`Mod Files`** folder inside it.
2. Create a folder called `zm_qol` in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plutonium\storage\t6\mods\` *(on Linux, the same path inside your Plutonium prefix).*
3. Copy these five files into it: `mod.ff`, `mod.iwd`, `mod.json`, `mod.all.sabl`, `mod.all.sabs`. Nothing else is needed.
4. Launch Plutonium T6 → **Zombies → Mods → Quality Of Life**.

## Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Plutonium deletes ReShade every time it starts** — it clears anything it doesn't recognise out of its own `bin` folder. Launch with **`Play BO2 with ReShade.bat`** (inside `Mod Files`, or as the **Plutonium ReShade Watcher** Start menu shortcut) and leave its window open while you play; it puts ReShade back each time. Closing the window uninstalls nothing.

> [!NOTE]
> **Still in beta.** Some of the newest features haven't had a full play-through yet. Anything that turns out broken gets fixed or pulled.
>
> **Cloning the repo does not give you a playable mod** — `mod.iwd` is a build output and isn't tracked in git. Use the release.

<details>
<summary><b>In-game chat commands</b></summary>

<br>

Use a `.`, `!` or `/` prefix, or bind them to keys. Type `.help` in game for the current list.

```text
.help                     Show / hide the in-game command list
.give <weapon> [pap]      Give any weapon ('.give list' shows what's available)

.pack / .unpack           Pack-a-Punch or unpack the held weapon
.giveperks / .removeperks Grant or remove perks
.pay <player> <amount>    Send points to another player
.character <1-4>          Pick your own character (each player, not the host's choice)
.shield / .staff <elem>   Spawn a shield or an Origins elemental staff
```

## Weapons

* **Campaign and Multiplayer guns/equipment in the box:**
  * Storm PSR
  * Dragunov
  * SPAS-12
  * SWAT-556
  * FAL OSW
  * Mk 48
  * QBB LSW
  * MP7
  * Vector K10
  * MSMC
  * Peacekeeper
  * Crossbow
  * XPR-50
  * Titus-6
  * Tac-45

* **DLC5 wonder weapons:**
  * The Wave Gun
  * Thundergun
  * Wunderwaffe DG-2
  * Winter's Howl

* **Bouncing Betties:**
  * The multiplayer proximity mine, in the Mystery Box on every map except Origins and Buried. They sit alongside your Claymores rather than replacing them, and use their own equipment button.

* **Jet Gun clean-up:**
  * It's carried as a normal primary that cycles with your other guns instead of living in an equipment slot, so it costs a real weapon slot and respects Mule Kick. Still overheats, never breaks.

---

## Maps, Power-ups, and Perks

**Bonus Survival maps:**
* **TranZit**
  * Diner
  * Power Station
  * Tunnel
* **Die Rise**
  * Shopping Mall
  * Dragon Rooftop
  * Sweatshop
* **Mob of the Dead**
  * Cell Block
* **Buried**
  * Borough

* **Der Wunderfizz Machine on all maps:**
  * The random perk machine is available on every map, not just Origins.

* **No perk limit:**
  * Carry as many as you like by default, or set a cap of 1–12 from the pre-game lobby.

* **Instant Pack-a-Punch:**
  * Instant Pack-a-Punch, like in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War - Zombies. It can be turned on or off in the settings menu.

* **Bonfire Sale:**
  * BO1's Pack-a-Punch power-up, from *Five*. Pick it up and Pack-a-Punch costs 1,000 points instead of 5,000 for thirty seconds. Part of the **Custom Power-Ups** option, on every map except Mob of the Dead and Buried.

---

## Presentation

* **Animated Pack-a-Punch camo:**
  * Every Pack-a-Punched gun gets the *Dark Matter* animated camo on all six maps; switch it off and each map uses its own stock PaP camo. The textures ship in the [HD Texture Pack](#standalone-downloads), so install that for the option to do anything.

* **Timers and counters:**
  * Game and round timers with configurable colours, plus a Cold War round counter.

* **Hitmarkers:**
  * Selectable hit, kill, crit and downed sounds, or off entirely if you prefer.

* **In-game menu:**
  * Mechanics, gameplay rules, HUD and audio options are all toggleable in game — no console commands. That includes a **VOICE LINES** switch for your character's spoken lines.

* **Extras:**
  * Native "Tap to Interact" controller support under the standard Gamepad menu, and a tailored *Cinematic Colour Grading* ReShade preset.

**Disclaimers/Other Information:**

This mod's code is mostly made using **Claude Code AI**; however, **ANY** and **ALL** artwork is human-made. I understand how controversial the usage of AI in any form is perceived to be, and that this will come as a disappointment to some; any criticism is understandable — I am not a coder, nor have I ever claimed to be. This project's initial intention was for it to be used by me, and me only. I have decided to open this project up as I understand that this could be quite resourceful.
